                <p class="description">
                    The Material Research Centre (MRC) within Foster+Partners had been developing a database in order to hold a record of all the material samples available in the library, 
                    and make it accessible practice wide.
                    When this database went live, it didn't have the impact that was desired, and so I was tasked with redesiging a system that could be more effective.

                <h1>The Context</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    The MRC has one of the biggest materials library, housing over 25,000 samples ranging from concrete to photovoltaics. The team had started using
                    an internal web-based application to record and manage this library with the intention of opening this database to the whole office.
                    <br><br>           
                    However it wasn't received as well as the team had hoped. I requested a tracker be implemented in order to see who was using it, and I collated this data over 4 months.
                    In general, the user count was perceived to be quite low averaging just under 3 hits per day:<br><br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="description">
                    From discussing directly with some of these users, there were a range of issues and pain points that they were experiencing:<br><br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Location focused interface, with a map taking up over 70% of a screen<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Small images of materials<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Problematic search that didn't function effectively<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Unnecessary information, and poor information hierarchy, resulting in a "busy" page that's hard to navigate<br>
                </p>
               
                <p class="description">
                    Problematically, there were  no clear performance targets set at the start of the process, meaning it was hard to accurately measure the success/failure post-launch, however the feedback was overwhelmingly negative.

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    With a number of issues with the application, I chose to go right to the start and clearly define the tool: <br>Who is it for, and why is it needed?
                </p>               
            </div>
            
            <div class="division workDivision">
                <h1>The Intention</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    Surprisingly the MRC hadn't viewed the tool as a primary way to manage the library. Instead it was seen as a tool for the office which could help alleviate work load from themselves by making the library accessible to the whole office.
                    However there weren't clear objectives as to how it would help with what designers were looking for, and so I ran a workshop to go through some user journeys to understand the potential use cases:
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/user_profiles.jpg">
                    <br>
                    From these 8 categories, I created a work tracking system, so that the team would log the type of queries they would recieve (amongst other information) to create a quantitative dataset of what was being asked:
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/queries.png">
                    <br>
                    This could then be cross-referenced with the functionality of the existing tool, to see how much it was actually helping and where the opportunities were.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>The Data</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    One of the main comments from external users was they "could not find what (they) were looking for". The team typically attributed this to poor search functionality of the database, however
                    they overlooked a crucial fact: that only a small percentage of the samples in the library were captured digitally.
                    <br><br>
                    This would have huge impacts on usership, after all, no one would use a maps service if only a fraction of the map was there:
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p id="gmaps" class="description">
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/google.png">
                    <img class="img gmap" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/nogoogle.png">
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    <br><br>
                    With an incomplete dataset, user count would always be poor as designers preferred to come to the library directly where they knew all the information physically way.
                    In order to try identify why there was so litle captured, a user flow was documented for the process of actually databasing a sample:
                    <br><br><br>
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/userflow.png">
                    <br><br>
                    When written down, it was clear that a 50+ step process to document a sample was far too long, especially with a library in excess of 25,000 materials. Over time the team had inundated the process with ideas of potential
                    information that could be useful, without actually validating their choices with the users, creating an overburdened process. This was communicated to management with a projection of how long
                    it would take to completely document all the samples:
                    <br><br>

            <div class="division workDivisionDark">
                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    With bigger questions being asked about the process, exercises were undertaken to see how the journey of a sample could be improved. However there were still issues
                    with the front end, and these too had to be addressed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="division workDivision">

                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/olddb.png">
                    The original design removed a lot of the focus from the actual materials, which didn't make sense for a materials database. Architects worked in very visual manners, relying 
                    on renderings, diagrams, images and photos to commuincate their design intention. As such, it made sense that the database should have much more focus on the
                    actual visuals of the material:
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/mrcd/newdb.png">
                </p>
                <p class="description">

                    <br><br>
                    A prototype version was created, with a small subset of materials to allow users to trial. The visuals were kept quite clean, with colour only being used to highlight
                    continuous themes e.g. Materials or Companies, in order to have a "clean" palette to bring attention more to the materials. A better information hierachy was created,
                    creating consistency between headings, and information, so that the salient information was clearly presented.<br><br>

                    At the current stage, the interface update is aimed at being an interim solution to a number of the UI concerns, making the tool more accessible.
