                    During my studies, I worked on behalf of the Brunel University along with Mitsubishi Materials to
                    reasearch and understand the properties of a precious metal clay (PMC).<br><br>
                    This was a self run project, with regular meetings with both the client and a supervisor, in order to explore 
                    how firing temperatures and times could effect the processing of PMC

                <h1>What is PMC?</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    PMC is a composite material, that was introduced to the public in 1990 by Mitsubishi Materials. The principle is that fine metal
                    particles can be held together with an organic binder, so that when it is fired, the binder burns away, and the metal particles can sinter
                    forming a solid shape.
                    It is comprised of:<br><br>
                    <b>Precious Metal Powder (70-90%)</b><br>
                    A variety of metal powders can be used such as gold, silver and copper, however these are imperceptible to the eye,
                    with particle size <200um. <br><br>
                    <b>Ethyl/Methyl Based Cellulose Binder with Water (0.8-8%)</b><br>
                    The cellulose binder holds the particles together, and allows for forming and moulding of them, whilst being
                    comprised of organic matter so that it can burn away cleanly. Ratios typically vary from 5:95 to 30:70 cellulose to water.<br><br>
                    <b>Alykly Benzene Sodium Sulphate (0.03-0.3%)</b><br>
                    This chemical known as Polysoap, is used as a surface active agent, breaking down any solid substances that may form as a reaction
                    from the water and cellulose<br><br>
                    <b>Oil (0.03-3%)</b><br>
                    Acting as a lubricant, the oil helps with the handability of the clay, and prevents adhesion to both packaging, and any moulds used in
                    the forming process.

                <p class="description">
                    Prototyping is great but there always needs to be an application for an idea, at the very least to drive 
                    the design in the right direction early on. 
                    <br><br>
                    Around this time I had read a news story on a cyclist who had died as a result of a traffic collision, 
                    and so I began to research this issue further to see what the contex was.

                    The initial focus was on the quanititive data on cycling in the UK. There were a number of studies available which provided an overview, 
                    especially with cycling on the rise, it was becoming a lucrative industry in the UK. Three statistics clearly stood out:
