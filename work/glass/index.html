                <p class="description">
                    Choosing glazing options for buildings can rely on a number of varying factors due to performance requirements laid out by legislation.
                    Each manufacturer has their own format for presenting this information, there are multiple
                    products that achieve the same performance, and there is not a single centralised resource which allows for comparison between them.
                    <br><br>
                    Being part of this process of glass selection, I saw an opportunity to design and create a tool to assist

                <p class="description">
                    Specifying glass into a building is a long and complicated process, and more often than not, non-linear. Although the architect would have been thought to be the driving force,
                    they are often referred to as the conductor of an orchestra of specialties ranging from visualisers to environmental engineers. A simplified process would be:

                <h1>The Research</h1>
                <p class="description 2col">
                    Whilst this is a big list of stakeholders, ultimately the architects and environmental engineers have the biggest influence on the decision making:<br><br>
                    The architects would relay the feedback from the client, and concentrate feedback from the various other support teams on the project. 
                    The engineers had "make or break" requirements, every building would have to comply with their laid out requirements, with no other acceptable outcome.

                <p class="description">
                    Speaking to the more experienced users who had worked on a few projects helped to piece together
                    idealised journeys:
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <p class="description">
                    There tends to be a lot of doubled work as well as stages that are repeated. Furthermore,
                    there are a number of hold ups relying on meeting company representatives, however this information is mostly static, and has routes to be made more accessible.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Going to the Source</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    I began to look at the datasheets, below are examples of the format from two different companies with two comparable products highlighted:
                    <a href="../../assets/media/glass/sgg_datasheet.JPG" data-lightbox="image-3" data-title="Saint-Gobain Glass Datasheet"><br><img src="../../assets/media/glass/sgg_datasheet.JPG" class="smallImg"></a
                    ><a href="../../assets/media/glass/agc_datasheet.JPG" data-lightbox="image-4" data-title="AGC Datasheet"><img src="../../assets/media/glass/agc_datasheet.JPG" class="smallImg"></a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the differences between these two include:<br><br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>An individual datasheet compared to a datasheet for all products available</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Overall differing graphical layouts</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Different levels of detail for each product on characteristics</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Different naming conventions and terms for similar performing products</br>
                    <br>
                    However there are multiple companies that offer products in this market, all suffering the same disparities as the above. I worked
                    directly with these companies to better understand their products and naming conventions:
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Using some basic VBA, I created a prototype tool in excel that housed the variety of data from the above suppliers,
                    allowing the entire dataset to be searched. Although "Quick and Dirty",
                    it proved effective in establishing what would be useful for the architects and engineers.

                <p class="description">
                    I began prototyping a web-based solution which could handle the streamlined data and present this information in an easy to use way.<br><br>
                    Whilst this was mostly fueled from the insights gained from the use of the prototype tool, no tool like this existed, and so the users had plenty of ideas and suggestions of what could improve
                    their workflow. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img" src="../../assets/media/glass/userbenefit.png" style="max-width:400px;">
                    <br>
                    These went through an evaluation process to judge feasibility and how beneficial they could be based on the research vs my limitation of time that I could spend working on implementing the features
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="wireframe" src="../../assets/media/glass/wireframe.JPG" style="width:100%; height:600px;" ></div>

            <div class="division workDivision">
                <p class="description">
                    Contrary to what was expected from a selection process that relied on prescriptive input, the engineers in particular sought the ability to "explore" the options. They would sometimes 
                    give a soft and hard limit for the performance, to allow for more of a discussion with clients and designers.
                    The tool was therefore divided into 3 sections:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Dynamic Inputs and Results</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    Here the user could "play" around with their performance requirements and filter down to the products that meet their requirements on the fly
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Detailed Information</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    When a particular product was selected, it would bring up further detailed information regarding other aspects of the glass that were usually asked such as:<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Maximum size available</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Contact information for company representative</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Glass build up the data is based on</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Other technical data</br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Selected Products</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    With a number of products that can meet the same requirements, users could build up a list of products for exporting out into their own tables, with all the data shown
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <img src="../../assets/media/glass/lowfiwireframe.png" class="img" style="max-width:600px;"></img>
                <p class="description">
                    <br><br><br>
                    One of the advantages of undertaking this project single handedly meant that feedback picked up could be almost immediately looped back into the tool as I would be able to
                    design and write it in myself. I went through a quick iteration process, implementing suggestions and feedback, and republishing for a select group to trial.

                    Following an initial approval process, the tool was launched onto the Foster+Partners intranet, along with a logger to be able to track who was using it. 
                    Overall it was received quite well, with a high number of users from various teams.<br><br>
                    Following this initial launch, the logger was analysed to reveal that the primary users of the tool were actually members from support teams, including EE, SMG, Sustainability and CRG.
                    I had spoke with some of them, and found that they had been using it both as a supporting tool when discussing with architects, but also for their own work which involves modelling or suggestions that 
                    require a range of products.

                <p class="description">
                    From the post-launch discussions, I had learnt a bit more about the culture that was unique to F+P. As mentioned at the start,
                    it's a large office, which allows for multiple teams to be able to support architects with their work. This means that although
                    the architect in theory has the biggest decisions when it comes to glass, they have the luxury of ensuring that there is someone
                    from a support team there to be able to help with the technical aspects of it<br><br>
                    There were also a number of suggestions from the situations where the technical experts were using the tool independently:<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>F+P Specific building data including past projects</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Further technical information such as spectral transmission data</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Rendered images or photos of the glass products in-situ on a building</br><br>
                    Some of these features are currently being evaluated for feasibility, and a design criteria will be drawn up for version 2.0
