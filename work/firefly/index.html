                    This project initially started from an innovative
                    material idea related to fibre optics. I had prototyped a method of
                    using fibre optics that had been altered and woven amongst normal
                    fabric, in order to create an illuminating textile.<br><br>
                    However early prototypes and discussions with a variety of
                    demographics, a more prevalent issue arose; not all cyclists indicate
                    when turning, and in the UK the majority of accidents occurred at or
                    approaching a junction.
                    As a result the focus of design shifted to target their behaviour,
                    and design a product that created better communication between
                    cyclists and other road users.

                <p class="description">
                    The project originally started looking at fibre optics: by opening the outer layer of a fibre
                    optic cable up, light is allowed to escape along the length. This then lead on to trying to
                    weave with the fibre optics and see how it can be applied.

                <p class="description">
                    Prototyping is great but there always needs to be an application for an idea, at the very least to drive 
                    the design in the right direction early on. 
                    <br><br>
                    Around this time I had read a news story on a cyclist who had died as a result of a traffic collision, 
                    and so I began to research this issue further to see what the contex was.

                    The initial focus was on the quanititive data on cycling in the UK. There were a number of studies available which provided an overview, 
                    especially with cycling on the rise, it was becoming a lucrative industry in the UK. Three statistics clearly stood out:

                <h1>Talking to the Right people</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    Through an organised event, I had the opportunity to speak with a variety of industry professionsals. This included the likes of Braiform, Brady, Saatchi and Saatchi amongst others.
                    From some open discussions, there were a few possible applications:<br><br>

                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span><b>Oil Rig Workers -</b> Whilst dealing with drills, there can be typically be a lot of oil overspill, especially in emergencies.
                    This results in their protective gear being covered in oil, and when close to the dangerous machinery, they need to be able to see where their hands are in the mess.<br><br>

                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span><b>Emergency Equipment -</b> When emergency services are called to an incident, having increased visibility is a must, and so having clothing
                    that could light up when required would be incredibly useful.<br><br>

                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span><b>Cycling Gloves -</b> Visibility for cyclists is always a concern, usually having to attach lights onto their bikes. There would be great opportunity to 
                    not only improve their visibility, but create a product that integrated the solution directly into it, instead of another add on.<br><br>
