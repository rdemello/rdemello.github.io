                <p class="description">
                    Sustainable design has always been an important facet of architecture, and usually encompasses the integration of the building into its surrounding environment as a whole.
                    However as the global temperature rises, the greenhouse gas impacts of construction are being put under further scrutiny. <br><br>
                    
                    Whilst there are practices in place to address the concerns of carbon, the tools used to carry out these calculations are either not focused in architecture, or relatively new.
                    Thus these methods are yet to successfully integrate into the design process, resulting in them usually being sidelined.

                    A manufacturer can work with a trained individual, in order to carry out a life cycle analysis (LCA) of a product they produce. 
                    There are ISO standards that this analysis must adhere to, which means there will always be a certain level of consistency between the set of information produced from different parties.
                    At the end of the study, the information is presented in the form of an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD).
                    Each EPD declares which parts of the life cycle it will be adressing: Production, Transport, Installation, Use, Disposal.
                    Typically there are two types of depth to an EPD:

                <h2>Cradle to Gate</h2>

                <p class="description"> 
                    This analysis takes into account the gathering, processing, transport and manufacture of raw materials into a product. 
                    It is the most common as it covers the phases that the manufacturer always has control of, and so they can declare the impacts of the product with a good degree of certainty.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Cradle to Grave</h2>

                <p class="description"> 
                    This analysis takes all of the above, as well as the other phases of transport, installation of the product, use and any maintence required, and finally the disposal at the end of it's life.
                    It is less common for a manufacturer to go to this level of detail due to the uncertainties and assumptions they must make after they have sold their product.
                <br><br>
                    However EPDs are technical documents that aren't friendly to non-experienced readers and can be difficult to understand.
                    
                    Whilst the information has been standardised to an extent, the first aim was to understand what the barriers to actually utilising it.

                    From speaking with architects and the managers on projects, the tasks related to sifting through the

                <h1>The Existing Tools</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    EPD's are the base datasets for tools that allow the comparisons of designs. 
                    They vary from free excel sheets, to fully-fledged software packages costing thousands of pounds.
                    <br><br>
                    These solutions attempt to address the issues, but the uptake is low. From some user trials and direct feedback,
                    the competition could be categorised into 3 types, with the following pros and cons:

                <p class="description">
                    The Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) Database was compiled by Bath University, in an attempt to provide some context to the most common building materials.
                    Although it was last updated in 2011, architects and sustainbility engineers were both familiar with and had used it in the past. However, one of the core issues
                    is the quality of the data. A number of the material profiles seemed to be based on research work, and not from full ISO complaint EPDs, partly due to how old the dataset is.

                    These mid-range tools were attempting to fill the sweet spot for the construction industry. They're process of building up an analysis carried the user through the steps of a building e.g.
                    the core structure volumes, facade areas and build ups, floor build ups etc. However there were still issues, which were limiting the uptake of these solutions, 
                    eTool LCD for example primarily used Australian based data, with varying grid emissions to the rest of the world.<br><br>
                    One Click LCA tried to present a simple one button solution that read a list of materials and provided results, however discussions with the company revealed that there weren't fail-safe methods in place
                    to ensure that the correct material profile was selected, meaning the results could be off by almost 100%. Whilst this range was a step in the right direction to other solutions, there were still barriers in place
                    that were slowing down uptake.

                    Both GaBi and Simapro are the established tools in the industry, with SimaPro having the larger market share. 
                    They have both been used to carry out the calculations in order to produce EPD's, with all this information on the systems, assumptions etc. included in the material profiles for transparency.
                    Although targetted at smaller scale products, they are both capable of calculations for buildings, with GaBi recently creating a Construction Database with specific material profiles.
                    <br><br>This level of detail comes at the cost of a higher entry skill level, and skill ceiling. Both organisations offer 2-3 day workshops in order to train users up in how to use the software,
                    which results in a bottleneck in the work flow if only a few people are trained in using it.

                    The project location will never change, but importantly by allowing them to search for a physical world location, this can be geocoded and the longitude and latitude can 
                    be used later to calculate estimated distances automatically.

                <p class="description">
                    The functional unit in EPD's vary so much, and architects are familiar with both volumetric values for elements such as structure, and surface area for the skin. Some of them even
                    struggled with converting between these functional unit, opening up the analysis to mistakes. By interpretting the EPD's, and forming a new dataset with comparable values, the user
                    would be able to choose their volumes in a language they were more familiar with.

                    The other tools require a value to be inputted for the transport in either km or miles, which would either be calculated using Google Maps or similar, or guessed entirely with an
                    arbitrary value. However this task could be automated through geocoding the place names and using a formula to calculate the distance, thus simplifying the process.
                </p>

                <h2>Transport Methods</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    There are times in projects where poor planning can result in the need for speedier transport. Whilst the actual distance is an obvious component in scaling the impacts of sourcing,
                    the transport method has a much bigger impact due to the magnitude of difference between transporting an item a certain distance between sea freight and plane (almost x100).

                    The existing tools keep the final outcomes behind the calculations, which can be a lengthy process. If changes were to be made to any of the entries, the entire process would have to be
                    started again. With all these variables, it would be essential to have the results update instantly, so that the user can quickly learn how the sustainability of their decisions.
