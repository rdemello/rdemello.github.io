                <p class="description">
                    A manufacturer can work with a trained individual, in order to carry out a life cycle analysis (LCA) of a product they manufacutre, resulting in a document called an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD).
                    Each has an overview of the analysis, ending with the resulting impacts of that product.
                </p>

                <p class="description"> 
                    However EPDs are technical documents that aren't friendly to non-experienced readers and can be difficult to understand.
                    
                    Whilst the information has been standardised to an extent, the first aim was to understand what the barriers to actually utilising it.

                <p class="description">
                    100 EPDs were selected, covering a range of typical building products including glazing, concrete, metal sheeting etc. 
                    The selection was reviewed with architects, to be able to ascertain what the issues were:</p>

                        <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>The level of detail varied considerably, length from 6 to 22 pages</br>
                        <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>There were inconsistencies in the functional unit applied for the calculations e.g. some would have a panel as a unit, others would have 1 cubic meter of material, or a tonne of material</br>
                        <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>There was no visual consistency between different companies</br>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p class="description">Ultimately this meant that the important information wasn't accessible to the designers.
                    From speaking with architects and the managers on projects, the tasks related to sifting through the 
                    information would be delegated to a handful of "experts" or not considered at all.
                    <br><br>
                    It was clearly important to understand what exactly the barriers were.

                <h1>The Competitors</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    EPD's are the base datasets for tools that allow the comparisons of designs. 
                    They vary from free excel sheets, to fully-fledged software packages costing thousands of pounds.
                    <br><br>
                    These solutions attempt to address the issues, but the uptake is low. From some user trials and direct feedback,
                    the competition could be categorised into 3 types, with the following pros and cons:
                </p><br>
                <h2>Entry Level</h2>
                <p style="font-size:0.9em" class="description">ICE Database</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) Database was compiled by Bath University, in an attempt to provide some context to the most common building materials.
                    Although it was last updated in 2011, architects and sustainability engineers were both familiar with and had used it in the past. However, one of the core issues
                    is the quality of the data. A number of the material profiles seemed to be based on research work, and not from full ISO complaint EPD's, partly due to how old the dataset is.

                <p class="description">
                    These mid-range tools were attempting to fill the sweet spot for the construction industry. They're process of building up an analysis carried the user through the steps of a building e.g.
                    the core structure volumes, facade areas and build ups, floor build ups etc. However there were still issues, which were limiting the uptake of these solutions, 
                    eTool LCD for example primarily used Australian based data, with varying grid emissions to the rest of the world.<br><br>
                    One Click LCA tried to present a simple one button solution that read a list of materials and provided results, however discussions with the company revealed that there weren't fail-safe methods in place
                    to ensure that the correct material profile was selected, meaning the results could be off by almost 100%. Whilst this range was a step in the right direction to other solutions, there were still barriers in place
                    that were slowing down uptake.

                <p class="description">
                    Both GaBi and Simapro are the established tools in the industry, with SimaPro having the larger market share. 
                    They have both been used to carry out the calculations in order to produce EPD's, with all this information on the systems, assumptions etc. included in the material profiles for transparency.
                    Although targeted at smaller scale products, they are both capable of calculations for buildings, with GaBi recently creating a Construction Database with specific material profiles.
                    <br><br>This level of detail comes at the cost of a higher entry skill level, and skill ceiling. Both organisations offer 2-3 day workshops in order to train users up in how to use the software,
                    which results in a bottleneck in the work flow if only a few people are trained in using it.

                    They had been tailored towards architects, with the input process relating more to a building than a product. 
                    They also limited their materials data to include only typical architectural materials, reducing the complexity when selecting the material list.

                    From discussions with the architects, I saw how they ideally would want to go through a process of selecting a material, and importantly how this could be supplemented
                    with cues and feedback to address some of the earlier issues.
                    <br><br>
