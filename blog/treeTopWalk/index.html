                    In September 2019, I had the chance to visit Krknose National Park in the Czech Republic.
                    Whilst the park itself was stunning with plenty of hiking trails, one of the sights to see 
                    (and climb) was the Tree Top Walk. This structure is a 45 meter tall circular walk way that 
                    ascends well above the tree line for great views of the surrounding forests, so high in fact 
                    that at the top you can feel the slight sway of the platform. With some walking before and 
                    after the, the overall path is around 1.5km. 
                    <br><br>
                    The structure is predominantly glue-laminated timber (glulam) with some 
                    steel work. The pathway up is all wood and the majority of the railing too. 
                    Any hints of steel are hidden by the overwhelmingly warm timber feel.
                    <br><br>

                    Aside from the beauty of the structure and of course the view, one other 
                    reason I particularly enjoyed this visit was the customer engagement on biodiversity. 
                    As you work your way along the trail, bright green plaques are dotted along the way with 
                    various comparisons of a natural biodiverse forest, and a monoculture forest which is only used for farming. 
                    This was a nice juxtaposition, particularly as the majority of the timber used on this project likely 
                    came from a monoculture, yet surrounding the structure were trees that were as old as 150. These comparisons 
                    were thinly veiled in their support for diverse/natural forests, even by labelling natural forests as “Pretty” and farmed forests as “Ugly”. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, what they did do successfully was highlight some genuine benefits in an engaging manner for all audiences. 
                    They covered the benefits to protecting the forest, longevity, cycles of decomposition, monetary value and more. 
                    At the time, I remembered to snap a few of them as it was the first time I had seen a tourist site not 
                    only broach this issue, but do it in a very simple way.

                    After reading up about it online after the trip, it appeared that there are a number of 
                    these walk ways dotted around Europe. Whilst I can’t speak for all of the Tree Top Walks, 
                    the one at Krknose was a great visit.
