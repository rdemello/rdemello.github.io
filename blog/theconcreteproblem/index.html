                    When you look around a modern city today, beneath the slick glass facades lies a material that dates back to ancient Rome. 
                    The versatility and availability 
                    of concrete has lead it to be one of the most consumed materials around the world. In 2014, it was found to be the 2nd 
                    most consumer material, only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630714000387">beaten by water</a>.
                    This had been the trend for some decades, only levelling of in recent years with

                    respectively, lagging someway behind.

                    Concrete is made up of many components, with cement acting as the binder that cures to 
                    hold everything together. Typically cement makes up 8-15% of concrete by volume depending 
                    on the strength required. However the majority of greenhouse gas emissions come from the 
                    production of cement, which is why it 
                    usually ends up being the focus of conversations around the sustainability of concrete

                    Close to 90% of the carbon footprint of concrete is from the cement production. 
                    Part of this is due to the energy sources used in the process predominantly being fossil fuel based, 
                    however a large portion is also released chemically during the

                    cement. Various clays and limestones are baked at high temperatures (1450c) and ground to form a fine 
                    powder with other mineral components. Furthermore the calcium carbonate within the limestone reacts during the baking
                    and forms carbon dioxide.

                    The increasing demand of concrete was by no accident, as the function it 
                    fulfils can be seldom replaced by other materials. Some of the largest 
                    concrete structure such as the Three Gorges Dam (pictured above) or the Hoover 
                    Dam would not be possible in other materials. There is even speculation that the 
                    concrete within the Hoover Dam is still setting, some 90 years after it’s initial 
                    construction, a testament to the pure mass of material used, and the research and 
                    development required to realise the structure.
                    <br><br>
                    Within our cities too, concrete is used everywhere from infrastructure projects, 
                    structures that sit above ground and the foundations that lay below. 
                    Beyond the cost effectiveness and availability, it also imparts increased thermal mass 
                    to a building, allowing it to normalise diurnal temperature variations and 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261911007148">lower the energy</a> 
                    demand of buildings to regulate internal temperature. 
                    <br><br>
                    2000 years ago, the Romans used chemically similar ingredients to create a concrete used to 
                    construct the Pantheon and the Colosseum. Whilst the concrete itself may be weaker than modern
                    day mixes, these structures that still stand today and will continue to in the future thanks 
                    to the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-secrets-of-ancient-romes-buildings-234992/">durability</a> 
                    of the mix the Romans had used.

                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward to today, and concrete is being reinvigorated with modern technology; 
                    <a href="https://www.3dprintedhouse.nl/en/">houses</a> (below) are being printed to benefit 
                    from unique builds ups and reduced wastage. 
                    Other mixes incorporate passive agents such as 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167577X19303003">titanium dioxide</a>
                    that limit the build-up of dirt and mould, 
                    reducing the required maintenance to keep the surface clean.

                    Concrete has found itself to be a cornerstone of modern urbanised areas, and doesn’t seem to be 
                    going anywhere soon. However, with imposing decarbonisation goals to reduce anthropogenic emissions, 
                    this multi-billion-pound industry is facing scrutiny as to how it will adapt.

                    The environmental impact of concrete has been no secret to the construction industry, 
                    and there have been many technological developments to address this issue. As expected, 
                    they generally focus on reducing the cement component in concrete mixes.
                    <br><br>
                    One method utilises by-products from other industries, which can be used to reduce 
                    the cement content. Iron is typically produced through a blast furnace, a large kiln 
                    that takes the ore amongst other ingredients. As part of this process, a slag is 
                    produced which is filtered off and generally considered a waste product. If this 
                    slag is allowed to harden, and then ground, it has a chemical consistency which 
                    works well as a supplement to cement, and is known as ground granulated blast furnace 
                    slag (GGBS). Similarly, fly ash is collected from the flues at coal plants, which 
                    can then be ground into a powder to supplement cement, known as pulverised fly ash 
                    (PFA). As both these substances are readily being produced in existing systems, they are
                    considered to have an extremely low carbon footprint. There are also codified 
                    <a href="https://www.cemex.co.uk/documents/45807659/45840198/mortar-cementitious.pdf/46571b2a-3efd-4743-20c8-d33feb1aed9d">grades</a> 
                    which take into account these cement replacements making it extremely accessible to specify
                    and use. However, the replacement alters the consistency of the final concrete, and as 
                    such there are limits to how much cement they can replace. Furthermore, both substances
                    are derived from industries that will likely shift away from their established processes.
                    <br><br>
                    As such there is now a rise of more innovative solutions that look to push what is possible. 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619307401">Geopolymer</a> 
                    concrete aims to replace the cement component entirely with an alternate binder 
                    with much smaller GHG emissions.

                    <a href="https://www.solidiatech.com/">Solidiatech</a> takes it a step further and use carbon 
                    dioxide in the setting process to sequester 
                    carbon during the curing process. Whilst this is still uses cement, it can find use 
                    for carbon dioxide captured through other processes.
                    <br><br>
                    These are just some of the technologies that being researched, with multiple options available. 
                    However questions are still raised as to whether incremental changes are enough, and how soon 
                    these technologies can be implemented.  Whilst concrete will still be used through our urban 
                    environment, there is still some hope that it will be able to clean itself up and start to 
                    cut down on its GHG emissions.
