                    As touched on previously, despite the historical use of timber in our society 
                    there has been an apprehension of large timber structures, particularly following 
                    large fires that plagued societies in the past. Furthermore, increasing population sizes led to
                    increased urbanised areas and greater population density, meaning architecture was 
                    stretched to new heights. Catalysed by the 
                    <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/fabric/first-century-skyscraper-short-history-2084">industrial revolution</a>, taller 
                    buildings previously made from stone or masonry, could be erected far faster 
                    and to new heights.

                    However, as the industrialisation trickled into other industries, the timber 
                    trade was reinvigorated with a spate of new technologies as covered here. As 
                    such the perception of timber is changing around the world, and so is the 
                    policy governing its use.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2017, China law changes that would increase the potential applications of 
                    timber. It directly increased the allowable height of buildings made using timber 
                    as the primary structure up to 5 floors 
                    <a href="https://www.margulesgroome.com/publications/chinese-wood-frame-construction-sector-development/">(GB/T51226)</a>. Furthermore, it would 
                    allow for up to 18 stories to be constructed with certain approvals from local authorities. 
                    Another more general directive 
                    <a href="https://www.margulesgroome.com/publications/chinese-wood-frame-construction-sector-development/">(GB50005-2017) </a>
                    came into effect in 2018, which 
                    would encourage the research and use of timber within the country. 
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, the UK banned the use of combustible material in external wall panels in 
                    <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/760536/Ban_on_combustible_materials_in_external_wall_systems_impact_assessment.pdf">2018</a>, 
                    following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40301289">Grenfell</a> fire in which many died. 
                    This was initially labelled as a 
                    <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/12/03/clt-exempt-combustible-cladding-ban-uk-government/">knee-jerk</a> reaction 
                    particularly as it not only applied to the cladding material, which was at fault in Grenfell, 
                    but also the wall itself, which can easily be protected from fire. As such, there is ongoing 
                    review and a petition to determine how this can be 
                    <a href="https://www.building.co.uk/focus/how-is-the-clt-industry-responding-to-the-combustibles-ban/5097651.article">adjusted</a>,
                    however in its current state, timber buildings can only use CLT on the exterior walls up to 18m high. 
                    This can be seen with generally lower rise buildings popping up, such as Google’s new 
                    <a href="https://www.hess-timber.com/en/references/detail/google-kgx1-london-headquarters/">London HQ</a> near Kings Cross.

                    In a dramatic contrast, 
                    <a href="https://www.moelven.com/mjostarnet/">Mjostarnet</a> (pictured above) was erected in Norway, currently holding 
                    the crown as the tallest timber building in the world. It stands at 85m tall, approximately 
                    18 stories, and is composed of both glulam and CLT, mostly sourced from nearby spruce forests. 
                    And it’s not alone, the

                    under construction in Austria aims to reach 84m tall, and

                    in Vancouver topping out at 53m, however both of these are designed with hybrid structures, utilising concrete elements for the cores.

                    More recently, Ursula von der Leyen even <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655">touched</a> 
                    on the potential it holds in the European Parliament 
                    State of the Union Address, as part of a push to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.
                    <br><br>
                    Even the UK Climate Change Committee published a 
                    <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/wood-in-construction-in-the-uk-an-analysis-of-carbon-abatement-potential-biocomposites-centre/">report</a> 
                    on how an adoption of timber 
                    construction for housing and low rise homes could be an effective contributor to the 
                    UK’s carbon abatement strategy. 
                    <br><br>
                    Timber is clearly starting to find its place in our urban environment, however in my 
                    future posts, I’ll start to scrutinise just how sustainable it can be.
