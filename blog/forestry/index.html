                    Generally for the structures in building, timber is used that is harvested from softwood trees (also known coniferous, 
                    evergreens or gymnosperms) which have pines or needles, and maintain their foliage through the year. They are typically 
                    found in boreal and temperate climates, such as Northern America, Northern Europe and Russia. This timber type is 
                    preferred over hardwoods as softwood trees are generally 
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111386/">faster growing</a>
                    and thus can reach a mature harvesting age at a lower overall cost per volume of lumber. Hardwood trees (also known 
                    as deciduous or angiosperms) can also be found in temperate climates, and are characterised by their loss of leaves 
                    during winter. However, they are common in tropical biomes too, and this is where the colloquial naming conventions 
                    start to blur. For example, tropical rainforests are typically made up of hardwood trees, but they generally labelled 
                    as evergreens due to their persevered foliage year-round. The map below has a good overview of the distribution of 
                    tree types, Hardwoods aren’t commonly used for building structures, but do have a place in products and high-quality 
                    finishes within buildings too, and as the desire for timber grows, so does the demand put on the forests around the world.

                    In order to cope with this demand, planted forests are popping up in Europe and North America, where the majority of 
                    structural timber (amongst other timber products) is produced. Some studies have found that 
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0411-9">global forest cover has actually increased over the past decades</a>, 
                    partially due these plantations. However, this overall increase is spatially disproportionate. The Amazon rainforest is notorious 
                    for the issues it’s faced with deforestation. The WWF estimates that if the current rate of deforestation continues, 
                    the Amazon will lose trees in 
                    <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/our_focus/forests_practice/deforestation_fronts2/deforestation_in_the_amazon/">27% of it’s biome by 2030</a>. 
                    Whilst some of the causes of this relate to the direct need and usage of lumber, an underlying cause for the mass 
                    deforestation is the expanding agriculture requirements such as 
                    <a href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching">cattle ranching</a>.

                    One method of preserving forests whilst providing a reliable source of lumber is through certification schemes such as the 
                    Forestry Stewardship Council (<a href="https://fsc.org/en">FSC</a>) and the 
                    Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (<a href="https://www.pefc.org/">PEFC</a>). Both aim to ensure that 
                    a forest is managed sustainably to ensure the continuous function and production of timber, as well as 
                    protecting rare and important species with certified forests. There are differences between the two: FSC 
                    can be described as a top-down approach, where each forest must achieve accreditation through the main body. 
                    On the other hand, PEFC was set up by forest owners, and focuses on working with regional governments to 
                    achieve certification. The latter method can then be cheaper, and makes certification a more achievable route 
                    for smaller forest owners, however it has also been the subject to criticism, as it allows for 
                    <a href="https://preferredbynature.org/newsroom/report-pefc-material-does-not-automatically-qualify-fsc-controlled-wood">less stringent pathways to certification</a>. 
                    <br><br>However both these organisations allow for clear labelling of products from forests, so that companies and consumers 
                    (like you), know that efforts have been made to protect the forests that are being harvested. Furthermore, 
                    external analysis have found these schemes do have 
                    <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2017/09/does-forest-certification-really-work/">positive impacts </a>
                    on the environmental protections on tropical forests. It is also important to note that although these schemes have benefits
                    once implemented, their adoption is note wide-spread, and is far more common in Europe and North America than other ragions (see below).

                    Furthermore there are a range of tools that can help highlight potential risks within certain regions of the world. 
                    For example 
                    <a href="https://preferredbynature.org/sourcinghub/timber">Preferred by Nature</a> 
                    has created risk profiles for different countries depending on how transparent their supply chains are with sourcing 
                    timber products, as well as how the areas of certified forests. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another great resource is the 
                    <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/">Global Forest Watch</a>, that uses publicly available data to map out 
                    tree cover, as well as gains and losses with varying canopy densities. Although some of the data points are limited 
                    and don't always span the same scales, it does generally show how different regions have changed
                    over time, particularly with tree canopy loss:
