                    Timber has been used as a building material for centuries, in fact the oldest 
                    timber building is thought to be 
                    <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/660/">Horyuji Temple</a> in Japan, estimated to have been 
                    constructed 1300 years ago. Although a lot of the original timber may have been 
                    replaced over time through restoration, it’s no small feat to have a building 
                    last for so long.  Some archaeologists have found evidence of primitive constructions 
                    dating back to 
                    <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/62369/the-worlds-oldest-wooden-architecture/">5500-5000 BCE</a>
                    using wood to line wells.

                    Up until the 21st century, timber as a building material likely had an image of 
                    being suitable only for small residential constructions. Log cabins may have been the 
                    predecessors, but timber framed buildings rose in 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817327172">popularity</a> for their flexibility, 
                    speed of construction and availability of materials especially in regions with forests. 
                    However, in more recent decades, advents in industrialisation have allowed this 
                    traditional and historic material to fast track itself into modern construction.
                    <br><br>
                    Engineered timber is a term for wood that has been cut and assembled in order to 
                    improve mechanical performance. For example, glue laminated timber 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978178242454300007X">(Glulam)</a> is composed of 
                    multiple pieces of wood glued together so that natural warping can be countered, 
                    and the overall size of a single member can far exceed the natural form of trees. 
                    Similarly, cross laminated timber 
                    <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/52580">(CLT)</a> uses layers of wood stacked on top of one 
                    another, where the grain directions are orientated perpendicular to one another, 
                    greatly improving the strength.

                    These products still have most of the benefits of the rudimentary solid lumber: 
                    flexibility, fast construction and general good availability, and so are used on 
                    various projects around the world. There are also auxiliary benefits to these choices, 
                    for example construction sites tend to be less polluting both in 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710218307903">particulates</a> 
                    and noise due to not requiring heavy machinery. One other benefit that is now 
                    being drawn into focus is how sustainable the material can be in construction. 
                    <br><br>
                    Common structural materials such as steel and concrete (and in fact most other materials) 
                    have associated greenhouse gas emissions, also known as 
                    <a href="https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon.html">embodied carbon</a>. 
                    This accounts for both the chemically produced greenhouse gases from any production process, 
                    as well as from the production of energy required in the manufacturing processes. 
                    What makes these engineered timber products unique is that as the tree grows, carbon dioxide 
                    is <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/tsbe/Darby_TSBE_Conference_Paper_2012.pdf">sequestered</a> 
                    into the wood. This means that from the growth of the tree, through to the 
                    production of the material, timber products have net negative GHG emissions.

                    The chart above shows how the carbon footprint of some timber products compares to some other 
                    construction materials. It’s important to note too, that a comparison by weight isn’t the 
                    most accurate, as structures designed with these materials will have different forms, 
                    volumes and weights, however whilst the magnitude of the difference may  vary, the function 
                    of the timber performing as a carbon sink is clear. Furthermore, due to the limited amount of 
                    processing required in comparison to other materials, even when the sequestered carbon 
                    isn’t counted, the timber products still perform similarly or better than their more 
                    common counterparts.

                    This environmental benefit has started to resound in the construction industry, with a 
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ragnar_Jonsson/publication/258027441_Prospects_for_timber_frame_in_multi-storey_house_building_in_England_France_Germany_Ireland_the_Netherlands_and_Sweden/links/0c960526a40463aa52000000.pdf">boom</a>
                    of timber-based structures. The combination of both CLT and Glulam can be used for the entirety of a 
                    structure above ground (typically foundations will be made out of concrete for durability), 
                    however hybrid structures are also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13632469.2014.916240">common</a>.
                    These utilise the best of both worlds, by combining 
                    steel, concrete and timber in different ways to ensure that each material is used effectively. 
                    Importantly, the inclusion of timber ensures that the overall GHG emissions of a building 
                    can be <a href="https://www.watermangroup.com/news/the-low-carbon-diet/">dramatically cut</a>
                    helping to 
                    <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/tsbe/Darby_TSBE_Conference_Paper_2012.pdf">offset the emissions</a> 
                    from other materials that don’t have these benefits.
                    <br><br>
                    Whilst timber-based buildings have a number of positives, it isn’t necessarily an easy win. 
                    Consideration must be given to safety, and of course, risk of fire. The Great Fire of London
                    was a key shift in historic policy away from timber framed buildings to 
                    <a href="https://www.modernmasonry.co.uk/mma/News-Events/2016/The-Great-Fire-of-London-a-step-change-for-concre.aspx">masonry and concrete</a> 
                    through the <a href="https://www.morrlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/partywall/rebuilding-of-london-act-1666.pdf">London Building Act of 1667</a>. 
                    Since then, regulations have since been updated to reintroduce timber to the built environment, 
                    designing efficiently and safely is still a priority. After all, a timber building that 
                    burns down not only risks the lives of its inhabitants, but also loses any potential 
                    environmental benefit by releasing the stored carbon back into the atmosphere. The end of 
                    life of timber products is also a contentious issue, as some scenarios result in GHG emissions 
                    greater than all the sequestered carbon originally stored (this will be covered in a later 
                    <a href="https://www.rdemello.com/blog/timberEndofLife/">post</a> in more detail). 
                    <br><br>
                    Whilst the construction industry is still wary of these issues, there is an undeniable 
                    increase in the use of timber both in the 
                    <a href="https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/215817-0">UK</a>
                    and around the <a href="https://greshamhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GHGTO2020FINAL.pdf">world</a>.
