                    As covered in the previous post, deforestation can be a contentious issue, however recent studies show that forest 
                    cover has generally increased. However this figure can mask an issue surrounding biodiversity. In some areas, forest 
                    areas are replaced with agriculture, however in temperate climates, the area is also utilised for planted forests. 
                    These planted ecosystems can sometimes be designated as monocultures, as unlike natural forests which can have a wide 
                    diversity of vegetation and animals, these planted forests tend to be focused on the production of just a single tree 
                    species for lumber. Allowing smaller vegetation to grow could reduce the efficiency of harvesting the lumber once the 
                    trees have reached maturity. As such, these forests usually have rows of aligned trees, with very little on the ground. 
                    Studies have also found that the “quality” of the wood can be better, with monoculture timber exhibiting

                    as well as having the capacity to improve degraded landscapes and rehabilitate deforested

                    However, in general, these benefits tend to focus more on the productivity of the forest from a harvesting perspective, 
                    and the reality is that forests can provide an even wider range of ecosystem services.

                    More recent studies have started to explore how mixed forests can have more valuable beyond their yield. 
                    Some of these benefits include increased biodiversity, water quality, aesthetic and recreational 
                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-015-0749-2">value</a>, 
                    as well as the reduction in vulnerability 
                    to pests and pathogens. The Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic that spread across North West America is an 
                    <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2015/04/pine-beetles-forest-destruction-canada-rockies/">example</a> 
                    of the risks from some pests: an entire forest comprised of just one species could face devastation and large 
                    changes in the land. However a diverse forest would be more likely to withstand such an attack. In some cases, 
                    carefully mixing in a variety of tree species can even results in better productivity and resilience of the 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235198941830088X#bib117">forest</a>, 
                    all while still having the capacity to produce lumber for the timber industry.

                    Along the same vein, there is a branch of agriculture called agroforestry, that focuses on the integration of agricultural 
                    systems forests. These can impart a range of benefits such as increased agronomic activity, 
                    soil biodiversity, water retention, reduced fire risk and 
                    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/17/7001">soil erosion</a>. 
                    This can come at the cost of crop yield from 
                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:AGFO.0000049435.22512.2d">specific produce</a> 
                    however, the underlying message 
                    with this practice is that it can be highly

                    There is plenty of evidence that that diversity in forests can result in a range of benefits, and 
                    doesn’t always come at the cost of productivity. Whilst these benefits can improve already degraded land, 
                    they shouldn’t be broadly applied, and used to justify continued deforestation, even if a mixed species 
                    forest is put in its place. A study by
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/biodiversity-the-ravages-of-guns-nets-and-bulldozers-1.20381">Maxwell (2016)</a>
                    had identified what the main threats were to threatened species from the IUCN Red List. With 8,688 species 
                    classified as threatened or near-threatened, 6,241 were at risk due to over exploitation, with the 
                    primary cause being logging. Timber can provide a viable route to lowering carbon emissions of the construction 
                    industry, it shouldn’t come at the cost of biodiversity, and other ecosystem services.
