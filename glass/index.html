                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p class="description">
                        My desk at F+P was located in a room filled with over 20,000
                        materials. One section of this room was devoted to double glazing
                        samples, with solar performance coatings applied to them.<br><br>
                        These kind of coatings were of huge importance in the industry, not
                        only did they dramatically affect the visual aesthetic of the building,
                        but they also needed to conform to performance requirements in
                        order to meet regulations, and create a sustainable building.<br><br>

                        Each company has their own format for presenting this information, there are multiple
                        products that achieve the same performance, there are different glass substrates, build-ups
                        and there is not a single centralised resource which allows for comparison between them.

                    Specifying glass into a building is a long and complicated process, and more often than not, non-linear. Although the architect would have been thought to be the driving force,
                    they are often referred to as the conductor of an orchestra of specialties. In a practice with so many disciplines inegrated into, this is more true than ever:

                    With the two primary users identified, I began to create user journeys for them. Unfortunately, as expected these aren't always straight forward. Not only do some projects take up to 7 years
                    to complete, there are numerous interactions, with different elements put on hold and restarted. Speaking to the more experienced users who had worked on a few projects helped to piece together
                    idealised journeys.

                    In both of these situations, there's a lot of doubled work as well as stages that are repeated. Furthermore,
                    the projects can go on for some time, so meetings that take place, and the knowledge gained from discussions
                    with the specialists tend to get lost.
                    <br><br>
                    Importantly, the key information from the suppliers isn't held anywhere formally beyond emails and individual data sheets.
                    This results in multiple consultations with company representatives in order to gain the information they require whenever
                    the there's a change of requirements, but a lot of this information is static, and there's potential to access it much quicker.

                <h1>Going to the Source</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    The next step was to understand the information that architects actually needed as at different stages, there are varying characteristics
                    that are considered for the glass product. <br><br>Towards the end of the specification process, it is inevitable that a company will be contacted
                    for information specific to that project. However in the first stages where vast ranges of glass are being selected from, there is a reliance purely
                    on the performance of the products.<br><br>
                    In these cases, the datasheets produced by companies are the source of the decision making. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="division workDivision">
                <p class="description">
                    I began to look at the datasheets, below are examples of the format from two different companies with two comparable products highlighted:
                    
                    
                    <a href="../assets/media/glass/sgg_datasheet.JPG" data-lightbox="image-3" data-title="Saint-Gobain Glass Datasheet"><br><img src="../assets/media/glass/sgg_datasheet.JPG" class="smallImg"></a
                    ><a href="../assets/media/glass/agc_datasheet.JPG" data-lightbox="image-4" data-title="AGC Datasheet"><img src="../assets/media/glass/agc_datasheet.JPG" class="smallImg"></a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the differences between these two include:<br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>An individual datasheet compared to a datasheet for all products available</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>There's overall differing format/layouts</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Different levels of detail for each product on characteristics</br>
                    <span class="bullet">&#9679</span>Different naming conventions and terms for similar performing products</br>
                    <br>
                    However there are multiple companies that offer products in this market, all suffering the same disparities as the above. 
                    In my role at the time, I was fortunate to be in touch with these companies on a regular basis,
                    and so used my contacts to start to get the companies on board. This group included:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../assets/media/glass/companies.jpg" class="smallImg" style="display:block; max-width:500px; width:100%;margin:0px auto;">
                    <br><br>

                    From discussions with them, I put together a database of all the datasheets from all the products of these companies. 
                    One of the early issues was inconsistencies in data between the products, but also not all the information included was relevant.
                    Using some basic VBA, I turned this into a prototype tool that allowed the entire dataset to be searched. Although "Quick and Dirty",
                    it proved useful in establishing what would be useful for the users.
