                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p class="description">
                        My desk at F+P was located in a room filled with over 20,000
                        materials. One section of this room was devoted to double glazing
                        samples, with solar performance coatings applied to them.<br><br>
                        These kind of coatings were of huge importance in the industry, not
                        only did they dramatically affect the visual aesthetic of the building,
                        but they also needed to conform to performance requirements in
                        order to meet regulations, and create a sustainable building.<br><br>

                        Each company has their own format for presenting this information, there are multiple
                        products that achieve the same performance, there are different glass substrates, build-ups
                        and there is not a single centralised resource which allows for comparison between them.

                    highlighting how each decision can affect the impact would be monumental in starting a shift
                    in perception.

                <h2>1. Project Location</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    With location being a vital contributor, starting with the project location would feed into the other calculations
                </p>

                <h2>2. Choose Material/Product</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Supporting information on each material and product would help clarify the decisions, ensuring accuracy in the calculations
                </p>
                

                <h2>3. Dimensions</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The functional unit in EPD's vary so much, so interpreting it and allowing dimensions to be inputted in volumes, or applied surface areas
                </p>

                <h2>4. Manufacturer Location</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    To calculate transport, other solutions require raw distance values e.g. "500 km". However with the searchable locations, this process can be done automatically with geocoding.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Transport Methods</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    There are times in projects where poor planning can result in the need for speedier transport. This cna results in much larger impacts, 
                    and so it would be valuable to provide options to see the disparity between different vehicles 
                </p>

                <h2>6. Results</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The existing tools keep the final outcomes behind the calculations, so if changes were to be made the entire process would have to be
                    started again. With all these variables, it would be essential to have the results update instantly
