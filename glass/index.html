                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p class="description">
                        My desk at F+P was located in a room filled with over 20,000
                        materials. One section of this room was devoted to double glazing
                        samples, with solar performance coatings applied to them.<br><br>
                        These kind of coatings were of huge importance in the industry, not
                        only did they dramatically affect the visual aesthetic of the building,
                        but they also needed to conform to performance requirements in
                        order to meet regulations, and create a sustainable building.<br><br>

                        Each company has their own format for presenting this information, there are multiple
                        products that achieve the same performance, there are different glass substrates, build-ups
                        and there is not a single centralised resource which allows for comparison between them.

                    Specifying glass into a building is a long and complicated process, and more often than not, non-linear. Although the architect would have been thought to be the driving force,
                    they are often refered to as the conductor of an orchestra of specialties. In a practice with so many disciplines inegrated into, this is more true than ever:

                    With the two primary users identified, I began to create user journies for them. Unfortunately, as expected these aren't always straight forward. Not only do some projects take up to 7 years
                    to complete, there are numerous interactions, with different elements put on hold and restarted. Speaking to the more experienced users who had worked on a few projects helped to piece together
                    idealised journies.
