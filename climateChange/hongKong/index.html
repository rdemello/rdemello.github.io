                    Like many cities around the world, Hong Kong faces various threats from climate change including heat stress, extreme weather events, 
                    flooding and drought (Cheung and Hart, 2012; Welford, 2008). In order to address these risks, the Environment Bureau of Hong Kong 
                    published the Climate Action Plan 2030+ (2017), laying out a roadmap to 2030 for mitigation of the effects of climate change and adaptation. 
                    <br><br>
                    One key focus of the report is electricity and energy generation, which is logical since 70% of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate 
                    from electricity production (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). In order to limit GHGs, the city aims to reach net zero by 2100, with a broad target of 
                    40-70% reduction of 2010 GHG emissions by 2050 (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). This could be seen as lacklustre, with other countries targeting net 
                    zero by 2050, and many having legislation proposed or in place (ECIU, 2020), however Hong Kong faces various challenges in its road to decarbonising. 
                    <br><br>
                    This reviews the context surrounding how the city is addressing its route to reducing GHG emissions, and why there is such a heavy focus on 
                    improving efficiencies.

                    Hong Kong is a subtropical coastal city, with the region covering 1106 km2. It is home to 7,482,000 people, and has a GDP US$338 billion (Hong Kong Gov, 2021). 
                    Although the population density isn’t one of the highest at 6,750 person/km2, Hong Kong is the city with the greatest number of skyscrapers in the world, 
                    with 6 buildings over 300m tall, 84 buildings over 200m, and 482 over 150m (CTBUH, 2021). In the post-war period, Hong Kong saw rapid development and 
                    became one of the fastest growing global economies (Chung et al., 2018). As the city developed, it became highly commercialised, with over 93.4% of its 
                    GDP originating from commercial services with the remaining falling under industry in 2020 (Hong Kong Gov, 2021).  This is exemplified in how the sectoral 
                    energy consumption has evolved over the past two decades (Fig. 1), where absolute energy consumption has halved for industry, whilst commercial and public 
                    services have increased by 2.5 times, and residential consumption has doubled (IEA, 2021). Energy consumption per capita has also increased considerably 
                    over this development period (Fig. 2), and could potentially rise further under a warmer future climate, with an increase of almost 10% in energy demand 
                    for residential sector and 3% in commercial sectors (Fung et al., 2006).

                    Historically, this demand was met primarily with coal and oil, with natural gas introduced in the late 1990s (Fig. 3). 
                    Hong Kong’s current ambition is to phase out coal and replace it with more natural gas (Fig. 4). Natural gas can emit 
                    approximately half the GHG emissions per kWh generated when compared with coal (Agrawal et al., 2013). Although this 
                    GHG/kWh efficiency gain has been scrutinised, as it is thought that methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure 
                    could eliminate the GHG reductions (Lenox and Kaplan, 2016; Lelieveld, 2005; Alvarez et al., 2012; Pandey et al., 2019), 
                    however, there are other benefits to the use of natural gas over coal such as reduction in pollutants (PM2.5, CO, NOx, CH4), 
                    reduction in mortality rates and increases in agricultural yield (Zhao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Burney, 2020).

                <p class="description">
                    The heavy focus on natural gas could be due to Hong Kong’s limited potential for local renewable energy generation. Currently, renewable energy makes up &lt; 
                    1% of electricity consumed, consisting of wind, solar and waste to energy (WTE) systems (IEA, 2021). The Hong Kong government estimates that only 3-4% of 
                    their energy demand could be met by these renewable technologies by 2030 (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). In the Climate Action Report, they cite barriers such as 
                    intermittent output of renewable energy, with issues such as “cloudy days, or where panels are occasionally shaded”, as well as the “considerably more 
                    expensive cost” over natural gas (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). Despite the limited plans to harness wind power, there have been numerous studies identifying 
                    sites around Hong Kong for installations, both offshore and on land (Gao et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2015; Lu and Yang, 2001; Shu et al., 2015) as well as 
                    systematic approaches to make it more cost competitive (Sun et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are also limited in their current 
                    application, with the majority of installations being small scale additions to existing buildings (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). Studies on the feasibility of 
                    PVs generally find that there is a lack of incentives, legislation, regulation and subsidies for the use of solar panels (Zhang et al., 2012; Ngar-yin 
                    Mah et al., 2018), highlighting a potential lack of engagement with PV usage from the government. Although not ruling out solar generation entirely, 
                    the government highlights potential routes to utilise space on tall buildings (Hui et al., 2017; Lu and Yang, 2010; Zhang et al., 2017). Whilst this 
                    may help alleviate the high future energy demand, it is unclear how much of a part they would place at city-wide reductions.
                    <br><br>
                    The majority of Hong Kong’s non-fossil fuel electricity is imported from the Daya Bay nuclear energy plant in Shenzhen, providing almost a quarter of 
                    all of Hong Kong’s consumed energy (Dou et al., 2021). Nuclear energy is generally perceived as being effective in reducing GHG emissions, although the 
                    long-term benefits may favour renewable energy generation (Jin and Kim, 2018). Furthermore, there can be challenges surrounding the perception of nuclear 
                    power plants, largely focused on the risks involved following previous disasters (De Groot and Steg, 2010; Stoutenborough et al., 2013; Ho et al., 2018). 
                    This is true for Hong Kong too, where the nuclear energy policies are seen as controversial by residents (Kwok et al., 2017; Ngar-yin Mah et al., 2014).
                     The current arrangement for imported electricity is due to expire in 2024, and there are currently no plans in place to renew it (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). 
                     The tenuous relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China also draws into question how much the region can rely on Chinese imports, particularly as 
                     further cooperation with mainland China is viewed as an unpopular option (Holley and Lecavalier, 2017).
                    <br><br>
                    Given these challenges, Hong Kong’s aspiration is to phase out coal entirely, replace it with renewables where possible and otherwise natural gas (Fig. 4). 
                    There have been no new coal plants built since 1997, and since 1996, 10 natural gas fuelled stations have been constructed, with further developments 
                    citing improved efficiencies (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). Although there are various programs in place to study sites for renewable energy, there are currently 
                    no planned large-scale developments.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    Given the outlined challenges on generation and importation of energy, Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan also highlights the efficiency of buildings and 
                    infrastructure. In 2017, 63% of GHG emissions came from electricity generated for buildings (Hong Kong Gov, 2017). Alongside the Climate Action Plan, 
                    Hong Kong’s Environmental Bureau published the Energy Saving Plan in 2015, which is a report on reducing the energy intensity of the built environment. 
                    The main goal of this plan was to reduce energy intensity by 40% by 2025, using 2005 as a baseline (Hong Kong Gov, 2015). The definition of energy 
                    intensity is given as energy demand per $ GDP. As a result, although GHG emissions have increased, and energy consumption in total and per capita has 
                    increased, the energy intensity for Hong Kong has decreased as per their target, largely due to the doubling of GDP over the past 15 years (World Data Bank, 2021). 
                    As a metric, Hong Kong’s energy intensity performs better than a number of other countries, partially due to its density and rapid commercialisation (Fig. 5).

                <p class="description">
                    The routes to achieving energy reductions generally focus on broad scale strategies: educating the public, supporting communities to be more energy 
                    efficient and increasing the frequency of reviews of key energy standards such as the Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance – BEEO (Hong Kong Gov, 2015). 
                    The plan has more specific goals too, such as achieving a 5% electricity usage reduction in government buildings by 2020 (with 2014 as a baseline), and the 
                    requirement of new government buildings to achieve BEAM Plus Gold, the second highest award for a commercialised sustainability accreditation scheme for 
                    buildings in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Gov, 2015). However, as a whole, the report focuses mostly on historic and current energy use in Hong Kong, with much smaller 
                    portions laying foundations for clear energy reduction strategies and targets. In the conclusion, the report admits that the 40% reduction target “is less 
                    than what some advocates have called for but this level of reduction is not without ambition. Our assessment is the public has the capacity to take 
                    responsibility to save energy but has yet to take greater action.” It’s indicative of a more passive stance from the government to achieving reductions 
                    in the private sector, opting to impose stricter regulations primarily on governmental and public buildings, whilst relying on existing regulations 
                    (e.g., BEEO) to incrementally improve the private sector. Historically this approach has seen successful improvements in building efficiencies, with 
                    a number of developments operating with improved energy use from 2004-2013 (Jia and Lee, 2018). The main drivers for these changes were attributed to 
                    various government policies, including the energy standards, and the BEAM accreditation.
                    <br><br>
                    The Climate Action Plan builds upon this foundation, advocating various strategies to reduce energy consumption in buildings, such as greater 
                    transparency of energy usage through declaration in a centralised database. This transparency has the potential to increase competitivity between 
                    building owners, to achieve greater energy efficiency (Mol, 2015). They also continue to highlight the importance of public engagement, to improve 
                    the knowledge of builders and owners, and encourage the use of more efficient systems such as Fresh Water-Cooling Towers, which have proven efficacy 
                    in reducing energy consumption (Jia and Lee, 2018). 
                    <br><br>
                    Another benefit of improving energy efficiency is that the improvements are generally passed directly to the tenant or building owner in the form of cost 
                    savings: whilst some may be indiscriminate to how their electricity is produced, being able to achieve financial savings due to reduced consumption could 
                    be a more palatable approach for the highly commercialised sectors. Studies have found that generally there is a cost benefit when looking at the lifecycle 
                    impacts of energy efficiency focused technologies for new buildings (Clinch and Healy, 2001; Chan and Yeung, 2005; Liu et al., 2014) and retrofit 
                    (Mahlia et al., 2005; Liu et al, 2018).
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Hong Kong faces many challenges on its road to decarbonising electricity. Although there has been criticism for a lack of engagement on renewables, the 
                    limited land availability poses real barriers to utilising these technologies at large scale, and as such there is a reliance on imported energy to 
                    make up large portions of non-fossil fuel sources. However, the mostly nuclear based import has an uncertain future too, so whilst the city moves away 
                    from reliance on coal and shifts to natural gas, further steps are required to secure lower carbon energy sources. 
                    <br><br>
                    Planning and guidance also focuses on improving the energy efficiencies of buildings. Targets have been set for reductions and efficiency standards 
                    for public buildings, with a broader goal of 40% reduction in energy intensity for the city as a whole. However the use of energy intensity can be 
                    misleading, affording growing energy consumption, as long as GDP continues to rise. Furthermore, the lack of stricter targets in the private sector 
                    could prove to be another barrier. Whilst energy efficiencies in buildings have generally improved in the city over the past decades, it’s unclear 
                    how much this contributes to broader goals. The government seems cautious of overregulating the dominant commercial sector, instead opting for a 
                    cautious approach to encourage more efficient buildings through public support and incremental improvements in energy standards, thus preserving the 
                    economic growth in a city that has seen accelerated commercialisation. Whilst the plans in place should help reduce future GHG emissions, it is 
                    unclear whether they will be enough to help limit global temperature increase.
