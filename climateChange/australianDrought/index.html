                    Australian climate is influenced by different modes of climate variability, including ENSO and IOD. 
                    Previous studies have found connections between the positive and negative states of these modes, and the precipitation and 
                    temperature anomalies in Australia. The region of 40<sup>o</sup>S to 10<sup>o</sup>S and 130<sup>o</sup>E to 160<sup>o</sup>E was selected in eastern Australia, and 
                    correlations between ENSO/IOD with temperature, precipitation and drought were found, where a positive ENSO and IOD respectively 
                    lead to drier conditions between September-November. The strongest of these correlations was found to occur in southeast Australia, 
                    where there is large agricultural area and population. Vegetation cover was found to lag drought by 1 month in the study region, 
                    with a decrease in correlation over longer lag periods. 
                    Furthermore, ENSO/IOD were found to be significantly correlated with a reduction of vegetation cover when a 1-month lag was applied.

                    Australia’s climate can be characterised by recurrent droughts, with precipitation variability as one of its key drivers (Kiem et al., 2016). 
                    High temperatures are thought to contribute too (Murphy et al., 2007), although the extent of their influence is contentious as it has been 
                    argued that high temperatures can be a result of drought, rather than a contributor (Sheffield et al., 2012; Lockart et al., 2009). It is 
                    well understood that El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is highly influential on Australia’s climate variability (Power et al., 1999; 
                    Shulmeister et al., 1995; Power et al., 2006) and more recently it is clear that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a significant influencer 
                    of climate variability too (Risbey et al., 2009; Forootan et al., 2016). The Australian population and agricultural industries are 
                    predominantly based in the South East and South West (Australian Gov). It is estimated that the global cost of drought is USD 80 
                    billion per year (WMO, 2017), furthermore future warming scenarios will lead to increased extreme weather events such as drought (IPCC, 2014), 
                    thus exacerbating the cost of drought. It is thought that Australia’s native vegetation has adapted to such climate variability, whereas 
                    introduced crops may not have such resilience (Nicholis et al., 1991). The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between the 
                    modes of climate variability (ENSO and IOD) and key vegetation parameters (drought indices, precipitation, temperature and vegetation indices) 
                    for the region of 40<sup>o</sup>S to 10<sup>o</sup>S and 130<sup>o</sup>E to 160<sup>o</sup>E across Eastern Australia.

                <p class="description">
                    The data was obtained and analysed within the <a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl">KNMI Climate Explorer</a>. Drought data was derived from the CSIC SPEI drought 
                    index for the period 1901-2018 (Beguería et al., 2020) where a positive value indicates wetter conditions and negative value indicates drier conditions. 
                    The precipitation data was obtained through CRU TS v4.04 at 0.5o steps for the period 1901-2019 (Harris et al., 2020) and the temperature data was 
                    obtained from the HadCRUT5 median anomalies for the period of 1850-2018 (Morice et al., 2020). The vegetation data was derived from NOAA Climate 
                    Data Record of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1981-2020 (Vermote et al., 2019) at 0.5o steps. Nino 3.4 was used from the ERSST 
                    v4 dataset (Huang et al., 2015), that represents the sea surface temperature anomalies across the Pacific Ocean (5<sup>o</sup>S to 5<sup>o</sup>N, 170<sup>o</sup>W to 120<sup>o</sup>W) for the 
                    period 1880-2020. The Dipole Mode Index (DMI) was selected from the HadISST1 dataset (Rayner et al., 2003), that calculates the difference between 
                    the Western Indian Ocean (10<sup>o</sup>S to 10<sup>o</sup>N, 50<sup>o</sup>E to 70<sup>o</sup>E) and Eastern Indian Ocean (10<sup>o</sup>S to 0<sup>o</sup>N, 90<sup>o</sup>E to 110<sup>o</sup>E) for the period of 1870-2020. 

                    SPEI, CRU TS Precipitation and HadCRUT5 temperature were made into time series, using the average and demanding at least 30% valid points in the region. 
                    Each time series was then correlated with Nino 3.4 and DMI for each month of the year and detrended to remove any noise from global temperature increase. 
                    The months with the strongest correlation for drought were selected for each mode (Oct-Dec for Nino 3.4 and Sept-Nov for DMI) and were linearly regressed 
                    with each mode to show the spatial distribution of the correlation.
                    <br><br> 
                    The lag in response of vegetation to drought conditions was also explored, to investigate how long it would take the vegetation to respond to drier or 
                    wetter conditions. The NOAA NVDI data was regressed against CISC SPEI at different monthly lag steps, ranging from 0 up to 4 months, where NOAA NVDI lags 
                    behind the CISC SPEI drought index.
                    <br><br>
                    Using the lag period with the highest correlation (1 month), Nino 3.4 and DMI were linearly regressed against NOAA NVDI for the selected months (OND and SON 
                    respectively) to show the spatial correlation between the modes of climate variability and the vegetation in the region.
                    <br><br>
                    In general, there is a significant correlation between each climate mode and parameter. CSIC SPEI and CRU TS4 exhibit similar patterns following the 
                    understanding that drought is heavily influenced by precipitation (Kiem et al., 2016).

                    Nino 3.4 is generally negatively correlated with drought and precipitation (Fig. 1a and 1b respectively): 
                    a positive El Nino reduces precipitation in the region and generally leads to an increase in dry conditions. 
                    This is observed across the year, however most strongly during October-December. On the other hand, DMI can be 
                    both negatively and positively correlated with drought and precipitation. During Jan-Feb, DMI strengthening 
                    leads to wetter conditions, whilst from May-Nov, DMI strengthening leads to drier conditions. When evaluating 
                    temperature (Fig. 1c), Nino 3.4 has both significant positive (Feb-Apr and Nov-Dec) and negative (Jul-Sept) 
                    correlations throughout the year. DMI showed some similarity in monthly correlations with Nino 3.4, with negative 
                    correlation from Jun-Aug and positive correlations overlapping at Nov-Dec). These results support that the chosen 
                    characteristics of climate change are correlated with the modes of climate variability.

                    the southeast, north and northeast of Australia. The area towards the southeast is of particular note, 
                    as this is where large areas of agriculture are based, implying that ENSO/IOD could have a strong 
                    influence over the vegetation cover in croplands.

                    When exploring the lag between NOAA NVDI and SPEI (Table 1), 1 month was found to have the highest number 
                    of significantly positively correlated months (11 months of the year) with the strongest correlation 
                    occurring Feb-Apr and Nov. The 2-month lag then had 8 months with significant correlations, and 3-month 
                    lag only resulted in 5 significantly correlated months. With no lag, the only significant correlations 
                    were present in October and January.
                    <br><br>
                    Both ENSO and IOD demonstrated a correlation when regressed against NOAA NVDI with a 
                    1-month lag (Fig. 3a and 3b respectively) over their periods of correlation with drought 
                    (OND and SON respectively). As both modes of climate variability strengthen over this period, 
                    there is typically a reduction in vegetation cover in southeastern Australia. The correlated 
                    area of reduced vegetation for the IOD is also much larger with respect to ENSO, although it is 
                    still concentrated in the southeast, where the majority of agriculture is based (Australian Government, 2020).

                    This study has demonstrated that drought, precipitation and vegetation are correlated with ENSO/IOD, 
                    which can lead to more extreme wet and dry conditions depending on the time of the year. Generally, 
                    ENSO is negatively correlated with wetter conditions, and IOD can be both negatively and positively 
                    correlated depending on the time of year which is well understood in literature (Power et al., 1999; 
                    Shulmeister et al., 1995; Risbey et al., 2009; Forootan et al., 2016). The areas which are most 
                    affected by the relationship of drought and ENSO/IOD overlap with areas of agricultural importance 
                    within southeastern Australia. Through regression, vegetation cover (NVDI) has been found to lag drought 
                    conditions by 1 month. A negative correlation was also found between ENSO/IOD and NVDI when utilising a 
                    1-month lag. Importantly, this relationship was found in areas that demonstrated correlations between 
                    drought and ENSO/IOD in south-east Australia. This implies that as ENSO/IOD strengthens, there is an 
                    increase in drier conditions in south-east Australia, which leads to a reduction in vegetation cover. 
                    However, this is a broad assumption and doesn’t take into account the resilience of individual species 
                    to drought (Nicholls, 1991). Furthermore, this analysis relies on correlation, which does not necessarily 
                    prove causation. For example, the latter half of harvest season can occur between September and November 
                    (Everingham, 2011), thus contributing to mass vegetation cover loss. Nevertheless, there is a demonstrated 
                    correlation between these modes of climate variability and drought conditions and vegetation cover, and 
                    highlights the importance of forecasting these modes of climate variability to carefully manage agricultural 
                    production and water availability (van Dijk, 2013; Verdon-Kidd, 2014). An area of further study could investigate 
                    which mode is dominant in years where both are in a positive state, and how the effects compound to influence 
                    drought conditions (Lim, 2016).
