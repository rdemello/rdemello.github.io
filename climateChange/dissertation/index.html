                <p class="description">
                    For my dissertation, I chose to model carbon emissions intensity (CEI) of energy use at a national scale, 
                    using artificial neural networks (ANNâ€™s), a form of machine learning. The intent was to evaluate how 
                    effective the ANNs were within this context, and interpret the results of CEI projections.

                    key points is provided below.

                    In order to train the ANNs, a set of developmental indicators were identified and data was collected from 1980-2014.  
                    This was done for the top 30 countries with the largest total greenhouse gas emissions. Different ANN architecture 
                    was trialled until a design was set on based on performance.

                    In order to interpret the models, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways were interpreted to model the development indicators 
                    forward to 2050 and 2100. These projected indicators were then fed into the trained networks, in order to predict CEI for 
                    each country under SSP1-5.

                    respectively), exhibiting improvements in accuracy for the majority of the countries compared to their individual networks.

                    For projections, the individual networks had two countries achieving zero CEI (Italy and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 
                    however they exhibited a high degree of uncertainty. Within the grouped networks, no country reaches a CEI of zero, with France 
                    achieving the lowest CEI, closely followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and other European countries. SSP1 generally 
                    presents good opportunities across all countries to lower CEI, however a number of countries perform slightly better with SSP4 and SPP5.

                    The number of countries failing to achieve a CEI of zero or lower could be explained by the limited data availability. As the ANNs 
                    also rely in historic data with 2014 being the last year used, they would not be able to accurately predict the inclusion of carbon 
                    capture and storage (CCS) systems, thus representing CO2 emissions created, but not necessarily emitted to the atmosphere. It 
                    therefore highlights the importance of CCS in limiting GHG emissions, with the likely continued reliance on fossil fuels.
