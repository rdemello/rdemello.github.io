                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    The first carbon taxes were implemented in Scandinavian countries in the early 1990s (Lin and Li, 2011) 
                    and as of 2020, 25 countries around the world have implemented carbon taxes at some scale, in total 
                    covering 5.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (World Data Bank, 2021). By putting a price on 
                    carbon, the taxes aim to curb demand for fossil fuel intensive products and the revenue generated is 
                    designed to help mitigate impacts of the emissions (Nerudová et al., 2016).
                    <br><br>
                    On the surface, a carbon tax seems like a fair measure to help reduce GHG emissions, with the largest 
                    polluters paying higher amounts. However, implementing a successful tax has proven challenging; 
                    Australia’s carbon tax implemented in 2012 was repealed following a change of government just 2 
                    years later (Crowley, 2017). Some difficulties in successfully implementing a carbon tax include: 
                    the application of such a tax across an economy comprised of multiple industries (Metcalf et al., 2008), 
                    potential economic regression (Meng et al., 2013) and the overall design of the tax and its features 
                    such as revenue recycling (Liu et al., 2015). There are then concerns with how a carbon tax disproportionately 
                    affects low-income households (Williams et al., 2015; Callan et al., 2009; Mathur and Morris, 2014), 
                    which in turn has contributed to the general negative perceptions of a carbon tax (Douenne and Fabre, 2020; 
                    Maestre-Andrés, Drews and van den Bergh, 2019). Despite these challenges, there have been successful 
                    implementations of carbon taxes which have reduced GHG emissions, with negligible economic impact and 
                    widespread public support (Murray and Rivers, 2015). This essay will evaluate and review carbon 
                    taxation through 3 framings: economic, justice and communication & politics.

                    <b>Economic</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Carbon pricing theory has been discussed in literature since the 1970s (Baumol, 1972; Montgomery 1972) 
                    and to date has been typically implemented under emissions trading schemes (ETS) and carbon taxation.
                    <br><br>
                    A carbon tax can be categorised as a Pigouvian tax, following Pigou’s theory on eliminating negative 
                    externalities from market activity through taxation (Nerudová et al., 2016). In the case of carbon taxation, 
                    the negative externalities are greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced through combustion of particular fuels or 
                    from the production of goods. By putting a price on these emissions, the tax increases the cost of commodities 
                    that rely on the combustion and use of fossil fuels, which in turn will reduce demand for these particular 
                    products (Metcalf et al., 2008). The revenue generated can then be used to offset financial impacts from 
                    emissions, but according to Pigou’s theory, the market should shift to cheaper (or comparable) goods that 
                    are less reliant on fossil fuels. 
                    <br><br>
                    As of 2020, there are carbon taxes implemented in 25 countries at a national scale, and 7 additional 
                    schemes implemented at subnational and regional levels (World Data Bank, 2021). Sweden has the highest 
                    rate at $133.26/tCO2e whilst Poland’s price is at a mere $0.08/tCO2e (Fig. 1). A balance must be struck 
                    when deciding on the price, Khastat et al. (2020) found that whilst the Finnish carbon tax was effective 
                    at reducing emissions, it negatively impacted the social welfare of Finns, and thus recommend optimising 
                    the future carbon price level to minimise this impact. Part of this variation is due to the interaction 
                    with other policies, for example the Finnish tax exempts companies that are part of the European ETS.

                <p class="description">
                    ETS (also known as cap-and-trade systems) places a cap on the GHG emissions for different industries, 
                    which is gradually lowered over time. Permits, or allowances, are then created per unit of emissions 
                    within the cap, which can be obtained from governing bodies, or traded with other companies. Organisations 
                    that operate under this scheme must monitor and report their annual emissions and obtain enough permits 
                    to cover their emissions or face heavy fines (Convery and Redmond, 2007; European Union, 2003).
                    <br><br>
                    There is often debate on whether an ETS or carbon tax is more effective in curbing emissions whilst 
                    having the least detriment to the economy. Although under carbon taxation, the price of GHG emissions 
                    is set by policy makers, while an ETS allows the market to set the price, the nuances in their designs 
                    can lead to varying efficacy. There are numerous studies that recommend carbon taxes over ETS (Wittneben, 
                    2009; Jia and Lin, 2020; Andrew, 2008) highlighting its economic benefits, while avoiding the intricacies 
                    of creating ETS systems and then allocating credits. A tax could avoid this complexity and apply a carbon 
                    price across industries and supply chains.
                    <br><br>
                    Inversely, Lin and Li (2011) demonstrate that while some countries have seen reduced emissions through 
                    the tax, they have also seen reduced growth in GDP. Barragán-Beaud et al., (2018) also demonstrate how 
                    trading schemes can be economically successful over taxation, and are viewed by stakeholders as market 
                    opportunities, as opposed to a burden on the industry. This is an important issue, as there are views 
                    that carbon taxation negatively manipulates the free market and can cause a loss in competitiveness. 
                    Gray and Metcalf (2017) review methods to tackle the anticompetitive nature of taxation and suggest that 
                    a credit-based rebate scheme could help offset the added cost to fossil-fuel intensive industries, 
                    having greater efficacy over simpler tax cuts. Similarly, Goulder and Schein (2013) highlight whilst 
                    both ETS and carbon taxation can have desirable effects in GHG reductions and economic growth, a hybrid 
                    system could be beneficial, which has been echoed by others (Li and Jia, 2017). Another method, to address 
                    international competitiveness would be to introduce border tax adjustments (BTAs), that place taxes on goods 
                    originating from countries without carbon taxes, to improve competitiveness for energy intensive industries (Dissou and Eyland, 2011).
                    <br><br>
                    One theme that underpins an effective carbon tax is how its revenue is recycled into the economy. Depending on 
                    the design of the tax, the government has the potential to generate large amounts of revenue as shown in Fig. 2, 
                    where in 2019, France generated just under $9 billion USD through carbon taxation. In literature, there are 
                    generally three common scenarios that are modelled: (1) no revenue recycling, where the government will use 
                    funds generated as they normally would, (2) lump sum rebate to households, or (3) tax cuts at the corporate or 
                    individual scale. A number of studies have found that implementation of a carbon tax with no revenue recycling 
                    generally leads to negative impacts for economic growth and welfare (Beck et al., 2015; Mathur and Morris, 2015; 
                    Benavente, 2016; Meng et al., 2012), the latter of which will be discussed in the following section. It is 
                    therefore advantageous to pursue scenarios (2) and (3), with tax cuts generally being perceived as the preferred recycling route.

                <p class="description">
                    Some studies have found that lump-sum transfers can still have negative effects on the economy and social welfare 
                    (McKibbin et al., 2015; Tuladhar et al., 2015; Jorgenson et al., 2015) although Klenert and Mattacuh (2016) found 
                    that there is variation in the lump-sum transfer when split across populations, which can impact whether the policy 
                    is regressive or progressive. Other studies have found that offsetting the carbon tax with cuts in other areas can 
                    limit the potentially regressive nature of the tax (Mathur and Morris, 2015; Liu and Lu, 2015; Beiser-McGrath and 
                    Bernauer, 2019). It is generally understood that some taxes can be distortionary and adding a carbon tax can amplify 
                    this distortion across a population (Bovenberg and Goulder, 2002). Therefore, using revenue generated from a carbon 
                    tax to reduce existing distortions can limit overall economic regression, whilst maintaining total government tax revenue.
                    <br><br>
                    Whilst these three scenarios have been highlighted, there are other methods of revenue recycling such as providing green 
                    subsidies or the cutting of national deficit. In the case of funding clean technology, whilst there isn’t extensive work 
                    on the understanding of the impacts of this recycling route, it is generally thought that it risks increasing economic 
                    distortions (Timilsina, 2018). On the other hand, the latter has been considered (McKibbin et al., 2015; 
                    Tuladhar et al., 2015; Jorgenson et al., 2015) but shows varying efficacy when revenue is used to cut debt. As such, 
                    recycling revenue through tax cuts (income tax, labour tax etc.) have shown to be the most effective at making a carbon tax progressive.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, carbon taxation is viewed as an effective economic tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The design 
                    of the tax is vital, along with effective recycling of revenue generated. Taxes can be inherently distortionary and 
                    manipulate the free market and also carry risk of being regressive. Despite these risks, there have been successful 
                    implementations such as in British Columbia at a subnational scale, where GHG emissions declined by 5-15% due to taxation 
                    with negligible impact on overall economic activity (Murray and Rivers, 2015).

                    <b>Justice</b>
                    <br><br>
                    As discussed, the design of such a tax can have implications on a country’s economy and overall social welfare, however 
                    studies have shown how there can be disproportionate burdens of carbon tax based on a range of factors, leading to an 
                    overall regressive policy and higher inequality. Low-income households, for example, spend greater portions of their 
                    disposable income on energy intensive goods and consumption. When modelling a carbon tax in France, Berry (2019) found 
                    that whilst household expenditure on energy increased with income, with the lowest 10% spending €2220 and the richest 10% 
                    spending €3778, this represented 16.4% and 5.3% of disposal income respectively. With the assumption that the tax would be 
                    applied by volume-energy consumed, they used the tax to income ratio to demonstrate how the poorest households would be 
                    impacted 2.7 times as much as the richest 10%. Similarly, Lee (2011) studied the enforced carbon tax in British Columbia, 
                    Canada; he found that in 2010 the poorest 10% of households paid 1.3% of their income in carbon tax, while the richest 10% 
                    only paid 0.3%. Furthermore, Lee also found that when accounting for tax cuts as means of revenue recycling, the richest 10% 
                    were (on average) net beneficiaries, receiving greater cuts than their carbon tax paid (Fig. 3). In contrast, the other 
                    percentiles were either found to have negligible impact, or to receive a loss.

                    As well as income variation, spatial distribution has shown to be an influencing factor in how the burden of a carbon tax is shared. 
                    Wier et al. (2005) studied whether the existing Danish carbon tax was regressive. The study came to similar conclusions on lower 
                    income households spending greater portion of disposable income when compared to the highest income households. They also found 
                    that the urbanicity of the household can impact the percentage of disposable income paid to tax, with families in rural areas 
                    typically having to pay more. It is thought that this increase is due to higher consumption of heating and electricity, as well 
                    greater vehicle usage. Brännlund and Nordström (2004) found similar spatial distortions, although more so when the revenue was 
                    recycled as subsidies to public transport. In those scenarios urban households experienced a net subsidy effect, whilst rural 
                    families bore an overall cost. Callan et al. (2009) drew similar conclusions from their study into a €20/tCO2 carbon tax for the 
                    Republic of Ireland. In terms of absolute cost, rural households would pay more €/week than those in urban environments, and as 
                    expected due to spending behaviour, the lower-income households generally experienced greater disparity when compared to their 
                    urban counterparts. They also identify that smaller households pay more tax per person than those with increased size, where the 
                    burden of electricity and heating can be shared between individuals. Unfortunately, this study did not look at the cost of the tax 
                    with respect to overall or disposable income, however, it does identify that this variation in spatial distribution can make it 
                    challenging to limit the regressivity of a policy when planning methods of revenue recycling through tax cuts.
                    <br><br>
                    There are fewer studies that focus on such disproportionality within developing nations, and the research available is less 
                    conclusive on the progressivity. Yusuf and Resosudarmo (2014) study the implementation of a carbon tax in Indonesia, finding 
                    similar differences with rural and urban households as those outlined above, however, they found that the percent impact in 
                    welfare for lower income households is generally progressive, with only the highest income households experiencing cuts. This 
                    is generally true for multiple revenue recycling methods. Brenner et al. (2007) highlight similar spending patterns between 
                    rural and urban households, leading to a potential disparity. They go on to find that if revenue is recycled equally on a per 
                    capita basis, the overall policy can be progressive: the lower income (mainly rural) households receive more than they pay, 
                    whilst the higher income (mainly urban) would pay more. Thus, could lead to a reduction in fossil fuel usage, and improved income 
                    equality. On the other hand, there have been studies that highlight how the tax policy can be more regressive in developing nations 
                    (Ojha 2009; Devarajan et al., 2011).
                    <br><br>
                    Although various designs of a carbon tax can achieve the intended goal of reducing GHG emissions, this implicit risk of inequality 
                    is challenging to navigate. The “polluter bears the cost” principle may still be true, however those of lower wealth can end up 
                    paying disproportionally more, and don’t always have the flexibility to adjust purchasing behaviours. Therefore, to implement a 
                    just policy, consideration must be given to how these distortionary effects can be compensated.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Communication & Perceptions</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Taxation as a market tool has often been criticised for its inability to impact the market proportionally (Rothbard, 1981). 
                    Furthermore, public perceptions of carbon taxes in particular have led to challenges in their utilisation. Australia had 
                    implemented carbon pricing in 2012, however it was repealed just two years later under Tony Abbott, who won the 2013 election. 
                    Abbott was a large supporter of the use of coal, and his campaign ran with the intention of removing the carbon tax, coining 
                    the phrase “axe the tax” (Crowley, 2017). He had previously promoted climate change denialism, being quoted saying “It doesn’t 
                    make much sense, though, to impose certain and substantial costs on the economy now in order to avoid unknown and perhaps even 
                    benign changes in the future” (Abbott, 2009). It is thought that his position on economic growth not being limited by climate 
                    change policy, helped secure the election amongst the conservative voters and climate sceptics (Crowley, 2017). 
                    <br><br>
                    In 2018, the yellow vest protests started in France, in part due to increases in fuel-taxes to help reduce carbon emissions. 
                    Similar to some of the studies discussed already, this tax resulted in low-income and rural households paying disproportionately 
                    more (Carattini et al., 2019) which formed part of a greater movement against inequality in France, where Macron’s policies were 
                    perceived to favour the wealthy (Royall, 2019). This levy in particular was seen as inducing a sharp rise in fuel prices, with no 
                    revenue recycled to the citizens (Carattini et al., 2019). There have been other cases where carbon taxes have failed due to lack of 
                    public support, such as in Washington State in 2018 due to perceptions on increased cost of living (Karceski et al., 2019). Although 
                    it was found not to have been a major influence, the anti-tax groups spent approximately twice as much as their oppositions and were 
                    funded largely through oil and gas companies (Karceski et al., 2019).
                    <br><br>
                    Given how carbon taxes can become highly politicised, communication and perception are clearly a challenge. Maestre-Andrés et al., (2019) 
                    found that if the pricing instruments are perceived as fair, and there is satisfactory information available about them from the government, 
                    acceptance usually increases. Reviewing studies across multiple countries, they found the most common concerns with carbon taxation included 
                    direct personal impacts (reduced purchasing power, higher energy prices and loss of jobs), disproportional impacts on poorer households and 
                    finally distrust in the government with the information available, particularly with how tax revenues will be used (Savin et. al, 2020). 
                    They also found that participants stressed the need for low-carbon transport, particularly in rural areas, indicating a general preference 
                    for tax revenue usage. This was also echoed by Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2019) who found that effective revenue recycling would generally 
                    help improve public acceptance of carbon taxes in Germany and the United States. In particular they found that tax reductions and rebates, or 
                    funding renewable infrastructure to be preferred recycling routes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Carbon taxation is generally understood to be an effective measure in reducing GHG emissions, by shifting the market to less 
                    fossil-fuel intensive goods. Whilst carbon taxes generally succeed in achieving GHG reductions, the design of the tax is vital 
                    to limit socio-economic impacts. There are clear risks in disproportionate impacts due to spatial and wealth variations, and 
                    limits to the flexibility of spending behaviour. Furthermore, the public’s perception of carbon taxes can vary, and in some 
                    cases it has led to a rejection in adoption. The topics that are of concern focus on the poorer households bearing a disproportionate 
                    burden, impacts to the free market regarding an individual’s purchasing power, and how revenue generated from the tax will be used. 
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, a well understood revenue recycling route is essential for an effective carbon tax. It can create an economically 
                    progressive policy, limit the disproportional burden and improve public acceptance. Providing cuts in other taxes have shown to 
                    be an effective component within a successful carbon tax policy, however the variations across developing and developed nations, 
                    as well as within each individual country, should be carefully considered to understand what the best use of revenue is. For 
                    example, although there is public acceptance for expenditure on low-carbon infrastructure, this doesn’t typically result in the 
                    most progressive economic outcome. Resolving these disparities is therefore necessary for a successful solution to climate change, 
                    beyond only reducing GHG emissions.
