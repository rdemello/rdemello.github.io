                    Discharge data from the Okavango River in Southern Africa was utilised in this study to understand potential change to the river regime under different scenarios. 
                    The study analyses a 2<sup>o</sup>c projected global temperature rise across 7 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP3 over a 30-year period, and a varying temperature 
                    rise from 1<sup>o</sup>c to 6<sup>o</sup>c using HadCM3 specifically. A form of Environmental Flows (eFlows) known as Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHAs) were applied to this 
                    data to understand how the river regime would be altered from its historical baseline. The frequency and magnitude of both low flows and high flows exhibited 
                    variation across the GCMs with overall increases and decreases projected to the discharge depending on the selected GCM. This uncertainty raises questions 
                    concerning the validity of selecting only HadCM3 to project future warming scenarios as it predicts an overall reduction in discharge for both low and high flows. 
                    With the Okavango River in particular, it is important to understand this variance especially in high flow conditions as the Okavango Delta is highly reliant on 
                    the seasonal flooding to maintain its ecological diversity.

                <p class="description">
                    Water scarcity is an issue faced by numerous communities around the world, but particularly in south western Africa. This arid and semi-arid region forces a 
                    heavy reliance on the water resources available for both basic human needs, and long-term societal development. The Okavango River is one of the largest water 
                    resources in this region. It is a transboundary system that runs through three countries beginning in the highlands of southern Angola as two tributaries, the 
                    Cubango and the Cuito, and then traversing through the arid regions of Namibia and finally opening out into the Okavango delta in Botswana. 
                    <br><br>
                    Under an NERC-funded QUEST-GSI project, a range of climate scenarios were applied to multiple basins including the Okavango. Seven General Circulation Models (GCMs) 
                    for a 2oc global temperature increase scenario, and 6 varying global temperature rise scenarios for one selected GCM were used to provide potential changes to the 
                    river discharge. Using a form of Environmental Flows (eFlows) assessment, a series of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) have been applied to this discharge 
                    data, to understand key characteristics of the river regime and the potential magnitude of impact of future warming scenarios in the Okavango. In particular, the low 
                    flow characteristics which are of importance to the communities along the stream, and the high flows that are critical to the flooding at the delta. Furthermore, 
                    the variability across the GCMs and implications of GCM choice were assessed.

                <h1>2.0 Methods</h1>
                <h2>2.1 The Okavango Basin</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The Okavango basin is a large transboundary system that extends through three nations in Southern Africa. In Angola, two rivers known as the Cubango and the Cuito 
                    both converge with other tributaries into the Okavango river just before entering Namibia. It then flows through Namibia and opens up into the Okavango delta in 
                    north western Botswana (Fig. 1). This basin is one of the larger Ramsar sites at over 700,000 km2 (West et al., 2015) and has been identified as being of significant 
                    importance due its role in aiding surrounding communities in meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Russi et al., 2013; Ramsar, 2019).
                    <br><br>
                    The river has a highly seasonal precipitation cycle, with a singular wet season between October and March as shown in Fig. 2, which causes extensive flooding at the 
                    Okavango delta wetland, the second largest inland wetland in the world. (Hughes et al., 2010).  This cyclic flooding creates a highly biodiverse environment that is 
                    home to a variety of species.

                <p class="description">
                    Due to its transboundary nature, significant contribution of water resources and ecological value in the region, the Okavango basin has been identified as an area of 
                    potential water conflict (Wolf et al., 2003). Since the end of the Angolan civil war in 2002, the state has been looking for routes to stabilise to help bring a number 
                    of its communities out of poverty. One strategy would be to tap into the potential hydropower of the river system through the construction of dams which could have 
                    dramatic consequences to the annual flooding and water supplies further downstream (Andersson et al., 2006; Pinheiro et al., 2003). At the delta, the flooding is an 
                    important factor in the ecological function of the site (Wolski et al., 2006; Wolski and Murray-Hudson, 2008) and is a major tourist attraction, contributing to 
                    economic growth in Botswana. With multiple communities also relying on the water resources provided by the river for irrigation and their livelihoods, the Permanent 
                    Okavango River Basin Water Commission (OKACOM) was established in 1994 so that the 3 riparian states could negotiate and coordinate the best possible uses of the water 
                    resources to meet the socio-economic demands of the developing nations, without unfairly disadvantaging one another, and doing so in the most sustainable manner.

                <h2>2.2 Future Change</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Whilst the Okavango is at risk of change from direct anthropogenic causes, there are concerns that potential future climate change could have additional adverse effects 
                    on the hydrological regime. It is generally accepted that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since the pre-industrial era have been contributing to a change in climate 
                    around the globe. Understanding the extent of this impact at a smaller and more focused scale is vital to ensuring the Okavango can be managed effectively.
                    <br><br>
                    At a GCM level, there tends to be a high degree of uncertainty in the results due to limitations in calibrations and validation procedures, and the overall scale at 
                    which the model is designed to run. However, risk analysis and adaption will typically occur at a basin-scale, to achieve a better understanding of the state of the 
                    water resources at the specific site to implement context-appropriate strategies. 
                    <br><br>
                    As part of an NERC-funded QUESTS-GSI project, a selection of future climate scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate change on river discharge at the basin 
                    scale (Todd et. al, 2011). The project used climate projections from 7 GCMs (CCCMA, CSIRO, IPSL, MPI-ECHAM5, NCAR-CCSM3, HadCM3, HadGEM) based on a 2<sup>o</sup>c warming scenario 
                    to assess the range of possible responses. Furthermore, HadCM3 was used with increasing increments of 1<sup>o</sup>c from 1<sup>o</sup>c to 6<sup>o</sup>c. Importantly, for each of these scenarios an 
                    ensemble of 1000 simulations were carried out to cover uncertainty within specific parameters in the Pitman hydrological model. These models were applied to a number of 
                    well-established basin sites, that had adequate historical baseline data including the Okavango at Mukwe in Namibia which had historical monthly discharge data from 1961-1990 inclusive.

                <h2>2.3 Environmental Flows and Indicators of Hydrological Alteration</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Environmental Flows (eFlows) can be described as ‘the quality, quantity, and timing of water flows required to maintain the components, functions, processes, and resilience 
                    of aquatic ecosystems which provide goods and services to people.’ (Forslund et al., 2009). One prescriptive desktop method for understanding eFlows uses the Range of 
                    Variability Approach (Richter et al. 1997) and employs Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHAs). The IHAs act as indices that rely on the fundamental principle that 
                    all characteristics of a river flow regime are ecologically significant, not just the minimum baseline flow. The selected indicators are outlined in Table 1.
                    <br><br>
                    IHAs were applied to the historical data covering a 30-year period from 1961 to 1990 inclusive to understand the baseline characteristics of the river. They were then 
                    applied to the projected discharge covering 30 years from 2040 to 2069 for the 2<sup>o</sup>c warming scenario across seven GCMs, and the increasing warming scenarios for HadCM3. 
                    These scenarios were then compared to the baseline data and methods. According to Laizé et al. (2010) a modified river regime is defined as one which deviates by at least 
                    30% from the baseline, and at least one month with respect to the mode of monthly timings.

                <h2>3.1 Discharge Data</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The baseline data was plot alongside the projected data over the two respective 30-year periods overlaid onto one another, for the seven GCMs (Appendix A) and the six 
                    projected climate scenarios (Appendix B). Appendix A shows a range of variability in the magnitude of discharge for the different GCMs, and that projections at 2<sup>o</sup>c 
                    follow the same seasonal hydrological cycle as the historical data. However due to the density of the data, it can be challenging to see how the GCMs compare, as 
                    such monthly averages were calculated for each GCM and shown in Fig 2. Two GCMs (CCCMA and NCAR) exhibit a clear increase in monthly discharge under a 2oc warming scenario, 
                    two GCMs (HadCM3 and CSIRO) show a general decrease in monthly discharge, with the remaining GCMs predicting monthly discharge of a similar or slightly reduced magnitude to 
                    the baseline data.

                <p class="description">
                    Appendix B shows the change in discharge of warming scenarios with increasing intensity using HadCM3. Generally, the seasonal hydrological cycle remains the same, 
                    with increasing temperature rise leading to decreases in river discharge. Note that there is also a spike at the 203rd month (Dec 2056) where the 6oc warming scenario 
                    has a much higher discharge than the others modelled.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to better understand the impacts on the river regime under the modelled scenarios, flow duration curves (FDCs) were plotted.

                    The overall flow is reduced with each increasing temperature rise scenario, as well as exhibiting the anomalous flow increase from 2056 under a 6oc future warming scenario. 
                    The low flows also show a progressive decrease under increasing warming scenarios.
                    <br><br>
                    In general, the FDCs show that the modelled scenarios across both the selection of models and warming scenarios exhibit a similar pattern to the historical baseline. 
                    The steep curve in the high flow region supports the seasonal flood regime of the Okavango, with the shallow low flow region indicating that that the river can support 
                    some continuous flow throughout the year.

                <p class="description">
                    As described previously, the IHAs were applied to the baseline discharge data and the projected discharge under the future warming scenarios across the GCMs. 
                    As the minimum and maximum data from the ensemble output of the parameterised hydrological model was available, these too were analysed to determine if there was 
                    any variation in the IHAs across the min, max and median. Table 2 shows the river characteristics for the baseline data, the various GCMs, and the increased warming 
                    scenarios for the median, with the max and min shown in Appendix C and D respectively. As per the criteria of Laizé et al (2010) where a 30% deviation from baseline 
                    is considered significant, changes have been highlighted in orange for a 30% increase from baseline, blue for a 30% decrease from baseline and yellow, for a change

                    There is little difference across the min, max and median models, with only the only change in the IHA from IPSLs flood frequency dropping slightly. In general, the 
                    CCCMA model exhibits an altered flood timing from baseline data and all other projections, which can also be seen in Fig. 2 with the offset peak river discharge in 
                    February. As shown in the previous figures for the GCMs, CSIRO and HadCM3 exhibit lower discharge with reductions in the flood magnitude, low flow magnitude and flood 
                    frequency, and an increase in low flow frequency and duration. Inversely NCAR predicts increases in flood magnitude and flood frequency, with a decrease in low flow 
                    frequency and low flow duration. CCCMA also exhibits an increase in flooding, with a reduction in low flow duration but a non-altered low flow frequency.

                <h1>4.0 Discussion & Conclusions</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    There is a large variation in IHAs between the selection of models, with several displaying significant deviation away from the baseline data. In general, the 
                    timing of the hydrological regime remains consistent with flooding occurring around April and the low flows occurring between October and November. Under a 2<sup>o</sup>c 
                    warming scenario, most of the models (5 out of 7) predict an increase in low flow characteristics for the Okavango. This reduction in discharge has potential to 
                    impact the communities that rely on the river for their livelihood, particularly if planned dams are constructed, potentially exacerbating the issue. Whereas the 
                    biodiversity at the delta is heavily reliant on the high flows from flooding, for example the nutrient influx from flooding can help spur ecological development (Mosepele et al., 2009). 
                    Changes increases in high flows could also impact the surrounding communities with unexpected flooding
                    <br><br>
                    However, the high flows show greater deviation across modelled outputs, with a split between a significant increase, a significant decrease and no significant change across models 
                    for flood characteristics. This spread highlights the uncertainty between GCMs as to their ability to characterises the high flows accurately, highlighting potential drawbacks to 
                    a single GCM selection for the multiple future warming scenarios model. 
                    <br><br>
                    Fig. 9 shows the hydrological regime for the historical baseline monthly average discharge (red), the monthly average discharge of all models predicting 2oc warming scenarios (blue), 
                    95% confidence interval for projections (blue error bars) and the monthly average min/max discharge from the parametrisation of the hydrological model. The average of the models shows 
                    a drop below the baseline flow, however the bigger range around this baseline highlights how the selection of a single model such as HadCM3 for the increasing warming scenarios may not 
                    be fully representative of the future.
                    <br><br>
                    The scale of the model is also of interest, as the basin covers an area of 700,000 km2, and the original Pittman model was developed for the smaller sub-basin around the Rundu 
                    (Hughes et al., 2011) of around 95,000 km2 in order to estimate the discharge at Mukwe. This was largely due to historical data availability and restrictions in the calibration process. 
                    Whilst this sub-basin is of a reasonable size to be covered by the cell resolution in a GCM, if data is available it would be beneficial to cover the full basin for a potentially more 
                    representative output of the whole area, and what potential impacts there are along the river and at the delta.
                    <br><br>
                    There is also the anomalous spike for the 6oc HadCM3 that is unexplained. Whilst the remainder of the data shows a general decrease in overall flow with the progressive temperature 
                    increase from 1oc to 6oc, the monthly average for December 2056 has a progressive increase in flow with temperature increase. This anomaly can be seen in the high flow range of the 
                    FDC in Fig. 7 and has been kept in the dataset for all graphs.

                <p class="description">
                    In regard to model selection, it’s important to note the age of the original study. The selected models were part of the CMIP3, the 3rd phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 
                    (CMIP) roadmap, that were used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Since then, there has been significant development in the CMIP framework, with CMIP5 implementing models for 
                    the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and currently CMIP6 models are being run for the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6).
                    <br><br>
                    Table 3 shows the various institutions and the models used in CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6. Most models have seen at least one iteration or update since the original set used in CMIP3, 
                    indicating that a potentially more accurate cohort of GCMs have been developed. Whilst CMIP6 is currently being run with modelled data being actively submitted for the October 2020 
                    deadline, from the resources available, it appears HadCM3 has not been included (ESGF CMIP6, 2020). However, HadCM3 is still being routinely used in other research, for example through 
                    the second phase of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (Hunter et al., 2019).

                    It’s clear that the discharge of the Okavango is vital to the ecosystem at the delta as well as communities within the basin. From the projections of increased warming, it 
                    could be possible to draw conclusions of the consequences from higher global temperature on risk of reduced flow in the Okavango. However, it’s also evident that there is a 
                    great deal of uncertainty from these models from the spread of monthly discharge under the same future 2<sup>o</sup>>c scenarios particularly at the high flows which are crucial to the 
                    routine flooding. Furthermore, there have been updates to the original GCMs used to force the hydrological model. It would be beneficial to utilise the updated and calibrated 
                    models for a better understanding of how the Okavango could be affected by future warming scenarios, thus enabling the states involved to better negotiate how to sustainably 
                    manage the water resource available.
