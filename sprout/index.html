                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    The sustainability of design is becoming an increasing concern in architecture. Whilst there are many methodologies to address it, and standards to aim for, quantitative methods for analysing a buildings impact are still relatively new and are yet to penetrate the design process.
                    Typically this would be outsourced to an external consultant, or if it wasn’t a priority, would be avoided.

                <h1>The Starting Point</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    EPDs (or Environmental Product Declarations) are independently verified reports conducted to ISO standards in order to evaluate a supply chains sustainability. 
                    They look at a range of environmental impacts across the lifecycle of a product in order to measure the sustainability of it.
                    
                    <br><br>However EPDs are technical documents, they aren't friendly to non-technically experienced users and can be difficult to understand
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="description">
                    100 EPD's were examined, and the following issues were found:</p>
                    <ul class="description">
                        <li>The level of detail and length varied from 6 to 22 pages</li>
                        <li>There were inconsistencies in the functional unit applied for the calculations e.g. some would have a panel as a unit, others would have 1m<sup>3</sup> of material</li>
                        <li>There was no visual consistency between EPD’s</li>
                        <li>There are a number of technical terms and acronyms that are rarely explained</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="description">Ultimately this meant that the important information wasn't accessible to the designers.
                    From speaking with architects and the managers on projects, the tasks related to sifting through the 
                    information would be delegated to a handful of "experts" or not considered.</p>

                <h1>The Existing Tools</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    EPD's form the datasets for tools that allow the comparisons of designs. They vary from free excel sheets, to fully-fledged software costing thousands of pounds.
                    <br><br>
                    These solutions attempt to address the issues, but the uptake is low. From some user trials and direct feedback,
                    the competition could be categorised into 3 types, with the following pros and cons:

                    From these options, the Mid-End options were the most common in industry. 
                    They had been tailored towards architects, with the input process relating more to a building than a product. 
                    They also limited their materials data to include only typical architectural materials, reducing the stress when selecting materials.

                    Being able to walk the user through the process, 
                    highlighting how each decision can affect the impact would be monumental in starting a shift
                    in perception.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Project Location</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    With location being a vital contributor, starting with the project location would feed into the other calculations
                </p>

                <h2>2. Choose Material/Product</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Supporting information on each material and product would help clarify the decisions, ensuring accuracy in the calculations
                </p>
                

                <h2>3. Dimensions</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The functional unit in EPD's vary so much, so interpreting it and allowing dimensions to be inputted in volumes, or applied surface areas
                </p>

                <h2>4. Manufacturer Location</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    To calculate transport, other solutions require raw distance values e.g. "500 km". However with the searchable locations, this process can be done automatically with geocoding.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Transport Methods</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    There are times in projects where poor planning can result in the need for speedier transport. This cna results in much larger impacts, 
                    and so it would be valuable to provide options to see the disparity between different vehicles 
                </p>

                <h2>6. Results</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The existing tools keep the final outcomes behind the calculations, so if changes were to be made the entire process would have to be
                    started again. With all these variables, it would be essential to have the results update instantly
