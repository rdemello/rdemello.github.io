                <h1>Project Sprout</h1>
                <p class="description">The sustainability of design is becoming an increasing concern in architecture. Whilst there are many methodologies to address it, and standards to aim for, quantitative methods for analysing a buildings impact are still relatively new and are yet to penetrate the design process.
Typically this would be outsourced to an external consultant, or if it wasnâ€™t a priority, would be avoided.</p>

                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p class="description">During my time at Foster + Partners (F+P), I worked as a material researcher collaborating with a range of teams across the practice, addressing architectural material issues.
                <br><br>Whilst in this position I worked with all kinds of disciplines and saw opportunities to streamline our workload and improve the way myself and my colleagues worked.
                <br><br>So using my design knowledge, and programming skills I was teaching myself in my own time, I put together a range of tools to be used by the employees of F+P.</p>
