                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    The sustainability of design is becoming an increasing concern in architecture. Whilst there are many methodologies to address it, and standards to aim for, quantitative methods for analysing a buildings impact are still relatively new and are yet to penetrate the design process.
                    Typically this would be outsourced to an external consultant, or if it wasn’t a priority, would be avoided.

                <h1>The Starting Point</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    EPDs (or Environmental Product Declarations) are independently verified reports conducted to ISO standards in order to evaluate a supply chains sustainability. 
                    They look at a range of environmental impacts across the lifecycle of a product in order to measure the sustainability of it.
                    
                    <br><br>However EPDs are technical documents, they aren't friendly to non-technically experienced users and can be difficult to understand

                <p class="description">
                    100 EPD's were examined, and the following issues were found:</p>
                    <ul class="description">
                        <li>The level of detail and length varied from 6 to 22 pages</li>
                        <li>There were inconsistencies in the functional unit applied for the calculations e.g. some would have a panel as a unit, others would have 1m<sup>3</sup> of material</li>
                        <li>There was no visual consistency between EPD’s</li>
                        <li>There are a number of technical terms and acronyms that are rarely explained</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="description">Ultimately this meant that the important information wasn't accessible to the designers.
                    From speaking with architects and the managers on projects, the tasks related to sifting through the 
                    information would be delegated to a handful of "experts" or not considered.</p>

                    There are solutions that attempt to address these issues, but the uptake is low. From some user trials and direct feedback,
                    the competition could be categorised into 3 types, with the following pros and cons:
