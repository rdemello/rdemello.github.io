                <p class="description">The sustainability of design is becoming an increasing concern in architecture. Whilst there are many methodologies to address it, and standards to aim for, quantitative methods for analysing a buildings impact are still relatively new and are yet to penetrate the design process.
Typically this would be outsourced to an external consultant, or if it wasn’t a priority, would be avoided.</p>

                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p class="description">During my time at Foster + Partners (F+P), I worked as a material researcher collaborating with a range of teams across the practice, addressing architectural material issues.
                <br><br>Whilst in this position I worked with all kinds of disciplines and saw opportunities to streamline our workload and improve the way myself and my colleagues worked.
                <br><br>So using my design knowledge, and programming skills I was teaching myself in my own time, I put together a range of tools to be used by the employees of F+P.</p>

                    EPDs (or Environmental Product Declarations) are independently verified reports conducted to ISO standards in order to evaluate a supply chains sustainability. 
                    They look at a range of environmental impacts across the lifecycle of a product in order to measure the sustainability of it.
                    <br><br>However EPDs are technical documents, they aren't friendly to non-technically experienced users and can be difficult to understand

                    100 EPD's were examined, and the following issues were found:
                    <ul class="description">
                        <li>The level of detail and length varied from 6 to 22 pages</li>
                        <li>There were inconsistencies in the functional unit applied for the calculations e.g. some would have a panel as a unit, others would have 1m<sup>3</sup> of material</li>
                        <li>There was no visual consistency between EPD’s</li>
                        <li>There are a number of technical terms and acronyms that are rarely explained</li>
